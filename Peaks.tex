\section{Introduction}
Sources of matter waves gained a dramatic improvement with the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases and the development of the atom laser \citep{Anderson:1995vn,Mewes:1997}. Like optical lasers before them, atom lasers can produce Heisenberg-limited beam profiles \citep{Busch:2002zr,Riou:2006uq} and promise high spectral density through their dramatically lower linewidth \citep{Wiseman:1997ba}. Another exciting possibility resulting from having such a coherent source of atoms is the generation of nonclassical matter waves through entangled beams. Such entangled beams are useful for tests of quantum mechanics and are required to perform Heisenberg-limited interferometry \citep{Dowling:1998,Reid:1988}. In this chapter, we show that the asymmetric scattering lengths between internal states of metastable helium (He*) cause well-defined peaks in the output of an atom laser. These peaks are due to a phase-matched four-wave mixing (FWM) process and are experimentally demonstrated.

A nonlinear process is required to produce entanglement, and one of the advantages of atomic systems over optical systems is that there are strong inherent nonlinearities due to atomic interactions, although these interactions can also lead to complications. These nonlinearities allow certain analogues of nonlinear optical experiments such as four-wave mixing (FWM) and Kerr squeezing to be performed directly in the atomic sample \citep{WallsMilburn}. All of these produce entanglement in optical systems. Four-wave mixing in a trapped BEC has been demonstrated experimentally in configurations where three distinct momentum states generated a fourth \citep{Deng:1999qy} and where two momentum states generated a pair of correlated atomic beams \citep{Vogels:2002}. These experiments demonstrated that the output phase was coherent, but the correlation properties were not measured. More recently the pair correlations in a spontaneous scattering of two colliding condensates were measured using the single-atom detectors available for He* atoms \citep{Perrin:2007}.

Using these existing sources of entangled pairs of atoms for interferometric experiments will be complicated by the high densities of the sources, where the nonlinearities that generated the correlations ultimately degrade the long-term coherence of the sample. While recent experiments have increased the coherence of atom interferometers by several orders of magnitude by reducing the nonlinearities with a Feschbach resonance \citep{Fattori:2008,Gustavsson:2008}, this precludes the production of entangled pairs. In our scheme the nonlinear interactions are used to drive FWM in the magnetically untrapped condensate, but the resulting untrapped beams that propagate in free space are dilute, potentially avoiding the decoherence problem. We show that pairs of beams can be produced simply by the process of radio-frequency (rf) outcoupling from a He* BEC, without the need for Feschbach resonances, optical traps, or scattering pulses. Unlike previous methods, which required pairs of atoms travelling at high kinetic energies as a source, this process involves scattering between atoms initially in the same zero-momentum state to create states with nonzero momentum. Semiclassical and field-theoretic simulations of the experiment show that the beams are generated by the same FWM process that generated entangled atom pairs in the earlier experiments.

\section{The metastable Helium `Peaks' experiment}
\label{Peaks:ExperimentalSetup}

The experimental setup for creating He* BEC has been reported elsewhere \citep{Dall:2007a}, and discussed earlier in this thesis (see \sectionref{He*Experiment}\footnote{FIXME: Correct this reference when this section is written}).

Starting from an almost pure BEC containing up to $5\times 10^6$ atoms an atom laser beam was created by using rf photons to spin flip the BEC atoms from the $m=1$ magnetically trapped state to the $m=0$ untrapped state.

After outcoupling, atoms in the atom laser beam fell under gravity for a distance of $\unit[4]{cm}$ until they hit a double stacked multichannel plate (MCP). The phosphor screen was imaged with a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera with a resolution of approximately $\unit[150]{\micro m}$ at the MCP. To remove any nonuniformities caused by spatial variations in the gain of the MCP, all images were divided by a flat-field image produced by dropping atoms from a MOT onto the detector. Since the MOT temperature is of order $\sim\unit[1]{mK}$, the spatial profile of the MOT uniformly illuminates the MCP. Although $m=-1$ atoms are produced by the outcoupling, especially for high rf powers, they are in general accelerated away from the detector by the magnetic trap field. Those that are accelerated towards the detector do not show up in the images since they arrive much earlier than the CCD trigger time.

\figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults} shows the dramatic change in the atom laser spatial profile when the condensate undergoes the resonant FWM process. In the case of low outcoupling Rabi frequencies (upper row), the FWM process does not occur and we see the usual double-peaked He*-atom laser profile \citep{Dall:2007} (see also \sectionref{TransverseProfile:Helium}\footnote{FIXME: Correct this reference when this section is written}). When the Rabi frequencies are high enough to initiate the FWM process (lower row), the atoms in the atom laser beam are scattered to form a halo around the main atom laser beam. Due to conservation of energy, the outer diameter of this halo corresponds to a maximum kinetic energy given by the chemical potential. As well as the ring structure, four peaks are observed on the outskirts of the profile.
% Each peak contains 11\%--14\% of the total outcoupled atoms, in agreement with the value of 11\% obtained from the simulation results shown in the lower row of \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}.

These peaks arise from two momentum-correlated cones of particles scattering out of the condensate and falling to the detector, as shown in \figureref{Peaks:Schematic}. The cones themselves are generated by a dynamical instability that populates momentum modes lying along the weak trapping axis, which expand to rings due to the mean-field repulsion in the tight trapping direction as they leave the BEC. Atoms in these cones then fall under gravity onto the detector, where the time-integrated flux is converted to a spatial density distribution, and each momentum ring appears as a double peak. The background halo is produced during the initial switch-on of the atom laser during which the peaks produced by the FWM process sweep in position from the main atom laser profile towards their final position in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}.

% FIXME: Somewhere in the experimental results we need to state that the momentum of the excitation in the weak trapping dimension is larger than the momentum width in the weak trapping dimension suggesting that something significant is happening along that axis. 

\section{Modulational stability analysis}

%While the argument in the previous section gives a qualitative explanation for the four-wave mixing process observed in He*, it is not entirely satisfying. In this section an approximate analytic expression for the excited modes of the He* system will be obtained and investigated using Bogoliubov stuff.

The observed peaks in the atom laser profile presented in the previous section are caused by a dynamical instability in the condensate that causes the formation of momentum excitations in a narrow range of momenta along the weak trapping axis. The background halo between these peaks and the usual atom laser profile is the result of (at higher detunings resonant momentum will vary across surfaces, during this initial switch-on phase, a range of momenta are excited)\footnote{FIXME: Complete and correct this sentence.}. These effects are due to the differential scattering lengths of the Zeeman levels of He*.

In this section, an approximative analysis will be performed to obtain the energy spectrum of small excitations to the condensate to determine the origin of the dynamical instability leading to the features observed in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}. The first approximation to be made is the local density approximation \cite{Stamper-Kurn:1999,Zambelli:2000} in which the condensate is assumed to be homogenous. This approximation will hold if the excitations under consideration have wavelengths much smaller than the Thomas-Fermi radius. The local density approximation will hold for this system as the axial momentum of the features observed in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults} corresponds to an excitation wavelength of $\sim \unit[5.2]{\micro m}$ significantly smaller than the Thomas-Fermi radius in the axial direction of $z_\text{TF} = \unit[175]{\micro m}$.

The second approximation to be made is to neglect the antitrapped state $m_F=-1$. Any density in this state leaves the condensate very rapidly due to the combined effects of both the mean-field repulsion and the magnetic field gradient. A classical particle in the centre of the condensate under the influence of the same effective potential experienced by the $m_F=-1$ atoms would leave the condensate in $\sim \unit[80]{\micro s}$, significantly shorter than the inverse Rabi frequency of $\sim \unit[300]{\micro s}$.

With these approximations made, the grand-canonical Hamiltonian $\displaystyle\protect{\hat{K} \equiv \hat{H} - \mu \sum_i \hat{N}_i}$ for this system is,
\begin{align}
    \hat{K} &\equiv \hat{H} - \mu \sum_i \hat{N}_i\\
    \begin{split}
            &= \sum_i \int d\mathbf{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \left(\frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2 M} - \mu\right)\hat{\Psi}_i + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i j} U_{i j}\int d\mathbf{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_j \hat{\Psi}_i\\
            &\phantom{=} + \hbar \Omega \int d\mathbf{x}\, \left(\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_0 + \hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_1\right),
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where $\hat{H}$ is the usual Hamiltonian operator, $\displaystyle\hat{N}_i= \int d\mathbf{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_i$ is the number operator for the $m_F=i$ state, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, $U_{ij} = 4\pi \hbar^2 a_{ij}/M$ is the nonlinear interaction strength, $a_{ij}$ is the s-wave scattering length between internal states $i$ and $j$. 

The equations of motion corresponding to this Hamiltonian are,
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
    i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \hat{\Psi}_1 &= -\frac{\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2M} \hat{\Psi}_1 + U \left(\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_1 + \hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_0\right) \hat{\Psi}_1 + \hbar \Omega \hat{\Psi}_0 - \mu \hat{\Psi}_1,  \\
    i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \hat{\Psi}_0 &= -\frac{\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2M} \hat{\Psi}_0 + U \left(\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_1 + \kappa \hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_0 \right) \hat{\Psi}_0 + \hbar \Omega \hat{\Psi}_1 - \mu \hat{\Psi_0},
    \label{Peaks:OperatorEquationsOfMotion}
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where $U=U_{11}=U_{10}$ and $\kappa = U_{00}/U_{11}$. For metastable Helium in the $F=1$ manifold, $\protect{\kappa \approx 0.74 < 1}$\footnote{FIXME: Cite something.}, while for atoms like Rubidium in the $F=1$ manifold, $\kappa \approx 1.01$ \cite{Ho:1998}. 

\subsection{The dynamical steady-state}

Typically stability analyses are performed about a stationary state \cite{Ho:1998,Robins:2001kx}, usually the ground state of the system. In this case, we wish to perform a stability analysis about the state in which all of the density is initially in the trapped state. Although this state is not stationary, it will be shown that it is periodic. This periodicity will enable a variation of the usual stability analysis to be performed in the next section.

Within the local density approximation we can assume that the mean-field remains homogeneous, it will be only the excitations that have spatial dependence. The equations of motion for the mean-field then reduce to the following ordinary differential equations,
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        i \hbar \frac{d \Psi_1}{dt} &= U\left(\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2\right)\Psi_1 + \hbar \Omega \Psi_0 - \mu \Psi_1,\\
        i \hbar \frac{d \Psi_0}{dt} &= U\left(\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2\right)\Psi_0 + \hbar \Omega \Psi_1 - \mu \Psi_0.
    \end{split}
    \label{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion}
\end{align}
Although solving these equations for $\kappa \neq 1$ is an intractable problem, it can at least be shown that the solutions are periodic. These equations are essentially a modified form of the optical Bloch equations with a nonlinear term. This can seen by defining $\Psi_i = c_i\sqrt{n}$ where $n = \abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2$ and considering the equations of motion for the density matrix terms $\rho_{10} = c_{1}^{}c_{0}^*$ and $w = \rho_{11}-\rho_{00} = \abs{c_1}^2 - \abs{c_0}^2$,
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{d\rho_{10}}{dt} &= -i\frac{g}{2} (1-w)\rho_{10} + i \Omega w,\\
        \frac{d w}{dt} &= 2 i \Omega \left(\rho_{10}^{} - \rho_{10}^*\right),
    \end{split}
    \label{Peaks:OpticalBlochEquations}
\end{align}
where $g = n U (1-\kappa)/\hbar$. As there is no loss in the system, the state of the system can be described by a point on the Bloch sphere (see \figureref{Peaks:BlochSphere}).  The system is not free to move anywhere on this sphere as the Hamiltonian must be conserved by its motion.  As demonstrated in \figureref{Peaks:BlochSphere} this restricts the system's motion to closed lines on the surface of the Bloch sphere, therefore requiring the system's motion to be periodic.

The Bogoliubov approximation separates the highly-occupied zero-momentum groundstate mode from the fluctuations about that mode by defining deviation operators $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i = \hat{\Psi}_i - \mean{\hat{\Psi}_i}$ and then treating $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i$ as a small quantity. These fluctuation operators obey the boson commutation relations $\comm{\delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{x}), \delta \hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger(\mathbf{x}')} = \delta_{i j} \delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}')$. To simplify notation the expectation value of the atomic fields will be written as $\mean{\hat{\Psi}_i} = \Psi_i$.

Making this replacement and keeping terms up to second order in the fluctuation operators gives
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \hat{K} =& -\sum_i \mu_i N_i^{(0)} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i j}U_{i j}\int d\mathbf{x} \abs{\Psi_i}^2\abs{\Psi_j}^2 + \sum_i \int d\mathbf{x}\, \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \left( \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2M} - \mu\right)\delta\hat{\Psi}_i\\
        &+ \sum_{i j} U_{i j} \int d\mathbf{x}\, \Big[\abs{\Psi_j}^2\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \delta\hat{\Psi}_i + \Big(\Psi_i\Psi_j^*\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \delta\hat{\Psi}_j + \frac{1}{2} \Psi_i \Psi_j\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \delta\hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger + \frac{1}{2} \Psi_i^* \Psi_j^* \delta\hat{\Psi}_i \delta\hat{\Psi}_j \Big)\Big], \label{Peaks:ConstantAndQuadraticK}
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where $N_i^{(0)}$ is the number of atoms in the condensate. There are no terms linear in $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^{(\dagger)}$ in this expression as they are all of the form
\begin{align}
    \sum_i \int d\mathbf{x}\,  \bigg( \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2M}\Psi_i - \mu_i\Psi_i + \sum_j U_{i j} \abs{\Psi_j}^2\Psi_i\bigg) \delta \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger,
\end{align}
where the term in parentheses is zero by assumption that the mean field $\Psi_i$ represents the ground state of the $m_F=i$ state with energy $\mu_i$. The constant terms in \eqref{Peaks:ConstantAndQuadraticK} only contribute a physically meaningless overall energy offset. The remaining quadratic terms in the grand canonical Hamiltonian are
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \hat{K}' =& \sum_i \int d\mathbf{x}\, \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \left( \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2M} - \mu_i\right)\delta\hat{\Psi}_i\\
        &+ \sum_{i j} U_{i j} \int d\mathbf{x}\, \Big[\Psi_j^2\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \delta\hat{\Psi}_i + \Psi_i\Psi_j\Big(\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \delta\hat{\Psi}_j +\frac{1}{2} \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \delta\hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger +  \frac{1}{2}\delta\hat{\Psi}_i \delta\hat{\Psi}_j \Big)\Big].
    \end{split}
    \label{Peaks:QuadraticK}
\end{align}

Having assumed the condensate to be homogenous, the system is now translation-invariant and the grand-canonical Hamiltonian will take its simplest form in a Fourier basis. Performing the Fourier transform of \eqref{Peaks:QuadraticK} gives
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \hat{K}' =& \sum_i \int d\mathbf{k}\, \bigg(\frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2M} - \mu_i + \sum_j U_{ij} \Psi_j^2\bigg) \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger(\mathbf{k}) \delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k}) \\
        &+ \sum_{i j} U_{i j}\Psi_i \Psi_j\int d\mathbf{k}\, \Big( \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger(\mathbf{k}) \delta\hat{\Psi}_j(\mathbf{k}) + \frac{1}{2}\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger(\mathbf{k}) \delta\hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger (-\mathbf{k}) + \frac{1}{2} \delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k}) \delta\hat{\Psi}_j(-\mathbf{k})\Big) .
    \end{split}
    \label{Peaks:QuadraticKKSpace}
\end{align}

In order to extract the quasiparticle excitation spectrum we wish to transform this quadratic Hamiltonian into the diagonal form
\begin{align}
    \hat{K}' &= \sum_n \int d\mathbf{q}\, \hbar \omega_n(\mathbf{q}) \hat{\Phi}_n^\dagger(\mathbf{q}) \hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q}) \label{Peaks:DesiredQuadraticForm}
\end{align}
for some continuous variable $\mathbf{q}$, discrete index $n$ and field operators $\hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q})$ satisfying the boson commutation relations. For single-component systems this is usually achieved by making the Bogoliubov transform
\begin{align}
    \hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{k}) &= u(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Phi}(\mathbf{k}) - v(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Phi}^\dagger(-\mathbf{k}), \label{Peaks:BogoliubovTransformation}
\end{align}
for some real functions $u(\mathbf{k})$, $v(\mathbf{k})$. It is not clear how this will proceed for multi-component systems particularly as it is expected that an individual quasiparticle excitation will include excitations in both internal states.

Instead we proceed by following the procedure of \citep{Leonhardt:2003} and recasting the problem as an eigenvalue problem by considering the Heisenberg evolution equation for an arbitrary operator $\hat{Q}$,
\begin{align}
    i \hbar \frac{d \hat{Q}}{dt} &= -\comm{\hat{K}', \hat{Q}}. \label{Peaks:HeisenbergEvolution}
\end{align}
The operators $\hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q})$ defined in \eqref{Peaks:DesiredQuadraticForm} evolve according to \eqref{Peaks:HeisenbergEvolution} as
\begin{align}
    i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q})}{dt} &= -\comm{\hat{K}', \hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q})} = \hbar \omega_n(\mathbf{q}) \hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q}).
\end{align}
Expanding the $\hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{q})$ in terms of the complete basis $\big\{\delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k}), \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger(\mathbf{k}): i \in \{0, 1\}, \mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^3\big\}$ gives an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue $\hbar \omega_n(\mathbf{q})$.  At first glance this appears to be an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem due to the infinite range of $\mathbf{k}$. As can be seen from \eqref{Peaks:QuadraticKKSpace} however, the fields $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^{(\dagger)}(\mathbf{k})$ only couple to  $\delta\hat{\Psi}_j^{(\dagger)}(-\mathbf{k})$ reducing the problem to a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem for each $\mathbf{k}$. Further, evaluating the commutator in \eqref{Peaks:HeisenbergEvolution} for the deviation operator $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k})$
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \comm{\hat{K}', \delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k})} =& -\bigg(\frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2M} - \mu_i + \sum_j U_{ij} \Psi_j^2\bigg) \delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k})\\
        &- \sum_j U_{ij} \Psi_i \Psi_j \big(\delta\hat{\Psi}_j(\mathbf{k}) + \delta\hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger(-\mathbf{k})\big)
    \end{split}
\end{align}
shows that $\hat{\Phi}_n(\mathbf{k})$ can be written as a linear combination of $\big\{\delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\mathbf{k}), \delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger(-\mathbf{k}) : i \in \{0, 1\}\big\}$ for each $\mathbf{k}$ reducing the problem to that of finding the eigenvalues of a $4\times 4$ matrix.

Solving for the eigenvalues gives the quasiparticle spectrum $\hbar \omega_\pm(\mathbf{k})$ as
\begin{align}
    \hbar \omega_\pm(\mathbf{k}) &= \sqrt{\varepsilon(\mathbf{k})^2 + U \varepsilon(\mathbf{k}) (n_1 + \kappa n_0) \pm U \varepsilon(\mathbf{k})\sqrt{n_1^2 + 2 (2 - \kappa) n_1 n_0 + \kappa^2 n_0^2} },
    \label{Peaks:QuasiparticleSpectrum}
\end{align}
where $\displaystyle\varepsilon(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2M}$ is the classical kinetic energy, $n_i=\abs{\Psi_i}^2$ is the mean-field density in the $m_F=i$ state, $U = U_{11} = U_{10}$ and $\kappa = U_{00}/U_{11}$. For metastable Helium in the $F=1$ manifold, $\kappa \approx 0.74 < 1$ while for atoms like Rubidium in either the $F=1$ or $F=2$ manifolds, $\kappa = 1.0 \pm 0.1$\footnote{FIXME: Citations needed}.  In the limit that the ratio of the scattering lengths $\kappa$ approaches unity the quasiparticle spectrum becomes
\begin{align}
    \hbar \omega_+(\mathbf{k}) &= \sqrt{\varepsilon(\mathbf{k})\left[\varepsilon(\mathbf{k}) + 2 U (n_1 + n_0) \right]} \label{Peaks:EPlusSimple}\\
    \hbar \omega_-(\mathbf{k}) &= \varepsilon(\mathbf{k}), \label{Peaks:EMinusSimple}
\end{align}
where $\hbar \omega_+(\mathbf{k})$ is the usual Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum \citep{Bogoliubov:1947} with total density $n = n_1 + n_0$. The quasiparticle energy spectrum $\hbar \omega_-(\mathbf{k})$ is the same as that for a free particle; this energy eigenvalue corresponds to an excitation that does not change the total density $n$ and hence does not affect the nonlinear interaction energy. In the more general case where $\kappa \neq 1$, the $\omega_+$ excitations should be interpreted as a maximal excitation of the interaction energy while the $\omega_-$ excitations should be interpreted as a minimal excitation.

A plot of $\omega_\pm(\mathbf{k})$ is shown in \figureref{Peaks:QuasiparticleSpectrum} for the case of equal densities in the $m_F=1, 0$ states and all other parameters corresponding those for the Thomas-Fermi groundstate of the metastable Helium condensate (see \tableref{Peaks:ExperimentalParameters}). An interesting feature of this plot is that it demonstrates that this system contains quasiparticle excitations ($\omega_-$) that require negligible energy, but have \emph{non-zero} momenta. The momentum of excitations at this resonance is
\begin{align}
    \hbar \abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}} &= \sqrt{2 M U \left[\sqrt{n_1^2 + 2(2 - \kappa)n_1 n_0 + \kappa^2 n_0^2} - (n_1 + \kappa n_0)\right]}. \label{Peaks:BogResonantWavenumber}
\end{align}


For momentum with magnitude less than $\hbar \abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}}$ the `energy' eigenvalue $\hbar \omega_-(\mathbf{k})$ is purely imaginary; in this region the $\omega_-$ excitations are dynamically unstable \citep{Leonhardt:2003}. The non-zero imaginary component of $\omega_-$ indicates a failing of the ansatz that the grand canonical Hamiltonian \eqref{Peaks:QuadraticKKSpace} can be diagonalised into the form \eqref{Peaks:DesiredQuadraticForm}. Instead, for excitations with momentum of magnitude less than $\hbar\abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}}$ the grand canonical Hamiltonian contains an irreducible off-diagonal component. Using the procedure of \citep{Leonhardt:2003} the grand canonical Hamiltonian can be written in the form
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \hat{K}' =& \int_{\abs{\mathbf{k}}<\abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}}} d\mathbf{k}\, \left[ \hbar\omega_+(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Phi}_+^\dagger(\mathbf{k})\hat{\Phi}_+(\mathbf{k}) + i\hbar \gamma_-(\mathbf{k}) \left( \hat{\Upsilon}_+(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Upsilon}_-(\mathbf{k}) - \hat{\Upsilon}_+^\dagger(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Upsilon}_-^\dagger(\mathbf{k})\right)\right] \\
        & + \int_{\abs{\mathbf{k}}>\abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}}} d\mathbf{k}\, \left[ \hbar\omega_+(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Phi}_+^\dagger(\mathbf{k})\hat{\Phi}_+(\mathbf{k}) + \hbar\omega_-(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Phi}_-^\dagger(\mathbf{k}) \hat{\Phi}_-(\mathbf{k})\right],
    \end{split}
    \label{Peaks:HamiltonianFinal}
\end{align}
where the $\displaystyle\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\hat{\Phi}_-(-\mathbf{k}) \pm \hat{\Phi}_-(\mathbf{k})\right)$ obey boson commutation relations for $\abs{\mathbf{k}} < \abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}}$ and $\gamma_-(\mathbf{k}) = \Im\{\omega_-(\mathbf{k})\}$. The application of this procedure and the forms of the operators $\hat{\Phi}_\pm(\mathbf{k})$ are detailed in \appendixref{PeaksAppendix}. As a summary of these calculations, the $\hat{\Phi}_\pm(\mathbf{k})$ are annihilation operators for excitations of momentum $\hbar\mathbf{k}$ with contributions from both internal states, and each of the $\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm(\mathbf{k})$ have equal-magnitude contributions from annihilation operators for excitations with momenta $+\hbar\mathbf{k}$ and $-\hbar \mathbf{k}$. An implication of these definitions is that the Hamiltonian \eqref{Peaks:HamiltonianFinal} does conserve momentum, although at first glance it may not appear to do so.

The second term in the top line of the Hamiltonian \eqref{Peaks:HamiltonianFinal} is equivalent to that for the non-degenerate parametric amplifier \citep{WallsMilburn}, which is a model for the parametric down-conversion of light by a non-linear crystal. In parametric down-conversion, two EPR\footnote{FIXME: EPR entanglement will need to be defined somewhere} entangled photons are produced at frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with growth rate $\gamma_-$ from a classical seed beam at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 + \omega_2$. Analogously, in the case of the He* BEC discussed at the start of this chapter Hamiltonian \eqref{Peaks:HamiltonianFinal} will result in the spontaneous formation of EPR entangled pairs of excitations, one in each of the $\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm(\mathbf{k})$ modes. As will be shown, these spontaneously-formed $\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm$ quasiparticles are the origin of the peak-like features in the experimental results in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}(b). %Although neither entanglement nor correlations could be measured in the experiment \dots  \emph{something about spontaneous formation of excitations being what is observed in the experiment.}

\subsection{Discussion of the $\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm$ quasiparticles}

\figureref{Peaks:ResonantMomentumGrowthRates} illustrates the important properties of the $\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm$ quasiparticles. \figureref{Peaks:ResonantMomentumGrowthRates}(a) is a contour plot of normalised resonant momentum $\abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}}/\tilde{k}$ as a function of the scattering length ratio $\kappa$ and $\displaystyle\eta = \frac{n_1}{n_1 + n_0}$, the fraction of the total density in the $m_F=1$ state, where the wavenumber normalisation constant is $\tilde{k} = \frac{1}{\hbar}\sqrt{MU(n_1 + n_0)}$.  \figureref{Peaks:ResonantMomentumGrowthRates}(b) is a contour plot of the normalised growth rate $\gamma_-/\tilde{\gamma}_-$ as a function of $\eta$ and $\abs{\mathbf{k}}/\tilde{k}$, where the scattering length ratio is that for He*, $\kappa = 0.74$, and the growth rate normalisation constant is $\tilde{\gamma}_- = \frac{1}{\hbar}U(n_1+n_0)$.

\figureref{Peaks:QuasiparticleSpectrum,Peaks:ResonantMomentumGrowthRates} indicate that the $\hat{\Upsilon}_\pm$ quasiparticles have the correct qualitative properties to cause the peak-like features in the experimental results in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}(b). These excitations can only be formed when the wavelength of the excitation is significantly smaller than either of the Thomas-Fermi radii or equivalently only for wavenumbers significantly greater than $k_z=\unit[3.6\times 10^4]{m}^{-1}$ in the weak trapping dimension and $k_\rho=\unit[6.7\times 10^5]{m}^{-1}$ in the tight trapping dimensions. 


Not only can these excitations be formed with negligible energy but non-zero momentum, but for this momentum to be large enough to have a corresponding wavelength smaller than either of the Thomas-Fermi radii, there must be significant density in the $m_F=0$ state. In the case of weak outcoupling Rabi frequencies as in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}(a), the $m_F=0$ state will be negligibly occupied preventing the formation of these quasiparticles, hence causing no additional structure to be observed experimentally. For strong outcoupling as in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}(b), the density will Rabi-flop between the $m_F=1$ and $m_F=0$ states causing there to be at various times significant density in the $m_F=0$ state that will enable the formation of high-momentum $E_-$ quasiparticles.  However, the largest possible momentum of these quasiparticles corresponds to a wavelength of the order of the Thomas-Fermi radius in the tight trapping dimension, but much smaller than the Thomas-Fermi radius in the weak-trapping dimension. Hence these quasiparticles can only be formed along the weak trapping dimension, eventually giving rise to the observed peaks. This effect also depends on the scattering length for collisions between $m_F=0$ atoms being significantly smaller than both the 1--1 and 1--0 scattering lengths as illustrated in \figureref{Peaks:ResonantMomentumGrowthRates}. For BECs using alkali atoms, $\kappa \approx 1$ preventing the effect from being observed as the resonant momentum would correspond to a wavelength larger than the Thomas-Fermi radius.

Although the spontaneous formation of quasiparticles with momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}_\text{res}$ would conserve energy, it would not conserve momentum. Instead the energy-momentum resonance must be the spontaneous formation of \emph{two} quasiparticles with momentum $\pm \hbar \mathbf{k}_\text{res}$ such as by a four-wave mixing process. Such processes are known to give rise to EPR entanglement between the excitations. This may lead to entanglement between atoms on opposing points of the cones in \figureref{Peaks:Schematic}, but due to the output dynamics and the vertical integration of the detection scheme, this would be difficult to measure. However, number difference squeezing between the opposing peaks should be far more robust.

Verification that the $\hat{\Upsilon}\pm$ quasiparticles are the origin of the peak-like structure observed in the experiment required a full 3D field calculation to be discussed in \sectionref{Peaks:3DCalculation}.  The argument made in this section that the observed structure is due to the formation of pairs of quasiparticles formed via a spontaneous four-wave mixing process indicate that a Gross-Pitaevskii model will be unable to reproduce the observations. Such a mean-field model will be insufficient due to the neglect of the vacuum fluctuations which are critical to all spontaneous processes. Before discussing the full quantum field calculation, we will first consider a more simplistic model for the formation of the quasiparticles in order to arrive at a more qualitative understanding of the system.

\section{Analytical mean-field model}

%A more qualitative understanding of the process discussed in the previous section can be obtained as follows.

                 text).

\end{figure}

The four-wave mixing process in this experiment occurs when stationary trapped and untrapped atoms collide producing superpositions of pairs of atoms with oppositely-directed momenta in the weak trapping dimension. In the terminology of the previous section it is two $E_-$ quasiparticles that are produced. Although superpositions of pairs of atoms will be produced, in this section we will simplify our considerations by only considering one component of this superposition as shown schematically in \figureref{Peaks:CollisionDiagram}(a). The four-wave mixing process producing these atom pairs is different to the usual four-wave mixing process where two atoms with non-zero kinetic energy collide conserving kinetic energy to scatter into different momentum modes. In this experiment two stationary atoms with \emph{zero} initial kinetic energy scatter into modes with \emph{non-zero} momentum. The source of this additional kinetic energy is  a reduction in the mean field interaction energy. As will be shown, in the case of equal scattering lengths the interaction energy either is unchanged by this collision or increases. However, He* has a reduced scattering length for 0--0 collisions as compared to 0--1 and 1--1 collisions, and the interaction energy is \emph{reduced} by the collision.

To see how the interaction energy can be reduced as a result of this collision, consider the simple case of uniform, equal background fields $\Psi$ in the $m_F=1, 0$ internal states in the absence of a trapping potential. The $m_F=-1$ state is neglected as it has negligible density compared to the other states. After the collision, the mean field in each state $\Psi_i'$ is
\begin{align}
    \Psi_1' &= \psi' + \delta \psi e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}}   \label{Peaks:MFCollisionT}\\
    \Psi_0' &= \psi' - \delta \psi e^{-i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}}, \label{Peaks:MFCollisionU}
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave-vector of the atoms after the collision, $\psi'$ is the mean field of the stationary atoms after the collision and $\delta \psi$ is the mean field of the atoms that have collided. These scattered atoms with momenta $\pm \hbar \mathbf{k}$ will interfere with the background stationary atoms in their respective states. This interference causes density gratings for both the trapped and untrapped internal states,
\begin{align}
    \abs{\Psi_1'}^2 &= \abs{\psi'}^2 + \abs{\delta \psi}^2 + 2 \psi'\delta\psi \cos (\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{x})\\
    \abs{\Psi_0'}^2 &= \abs{\psi'}^2 + \abs{\delta \psi}^2 - 2 \psi'\delta\psi \cos (\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{x}).
\end{align}
As the number of atoms in each state is unchanged, the density of each state can be rewritten in terms of the original background mean field $\Psi$ of each state as
\begin{align}
    \abs{\Psi_1'}^2 &= \abs{\Psi}^2 + \varepsilon(\mathbf{x})\\
    \abs{\Psi_0'}^2 &= \abs{\Psi}^2 - \varepsilon(\mathbf{x}),
\end{align}
where $\varepsilon(\mathbf{x}) = 2 \psi' \delta\psi \cos (\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x})$. 

The mean field interaction energy after the collision will be
\begin{align}
    \mean{\hat{H}_\text{int}} &= \sum_{i j} U_{ij} \int d\mathbf{x}\, \mean{\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_j \hat{\Psi}_i}\\
                              &= U \int d\mathbf{x}\, \left(\abs{\Psi_1'}^4 + \kappa \abs{\Psi_0'}^4 + 2 \abs{\Psi_1'}^2\abs{\Psi_0'}^2\right) \\
                              &= U \int d\mathbf{x}\, \left[ (3+\kappa)\abs{\Psi}^4 + 2 (1 - \kappa) \varepsilon(\mathbf{x}) \abs{\Psi}^2 - (1 - \kappa) \varepsilon^2(\mathbf{x})\right],
\end{align}
where $U_{i j} = 4 \pi \hbar^2 a_{i j}/M$ is the nonlinear interaction strength, $a_{i j}$ is the s-wave scattering length between the internal states $i$ and $j$, $U=U_{1 1} = U_{1 0}$ and $\kappa = a_{0 0}/a_{1 1} < 1$. For atoms like Rubidium, $\kappa \approx 1$ and the interaction energy factorises to only depend on the total density, which is unchanged by the collision. However, for metastable Helium $\kappa < 1$ and the interaction energy has reduced as a result of the collision,
\begin{align}
    \Delta\mean{\hat{H}_\text{int}} &= U (1-\kappa) \int d\mathbf{x}\, \left[2 \abs{\psi'}^2\varepsilon(\mathbf{x}) - \varepsilon^2(\mathbf{x})\right] \label{Peaks:DeltaInteractionEnergy}
\end{align}
as the first term in this expression averages to zero over one period of the density grating, and the second term is always negative, indicating that the interaction energy has \emph{reduced} due to the scattering. 

Performing the integral in \eqref{Peaks:DeltaInteractionEnergy} over some volume gives,
\begin{align}
    \Delta \mean{\hat{H}_\text{int}} &= -2 U (1-\kappa) \abs{\psi'}^2 N_\mathbf{k},
\end{align}
where $N_\mathbf{k}$ is the number of atoms in the integrated volume in the $m_F=1$ state with momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$. Due to conservation of energy, this reduced interaction energy must be balanced by the kinetic energy of the scattered atoms,
\begin{align}
    \mean{\hat{T}_1} + \mean{\hat{T}_0} + \Delta \mean{\hat{H}_\text{int}} &= 0 = (2 N_\mathbf{k}) \frac{\hbar^2 \mathbf{k}^2}{2 M} -2 U (1-\kappa) \abs{\psi'}^2 N_\mathbf{k}, \label{Peaks:SimpleEnergyConservation}
\end{align}
where $\hat{T}_i$ is the total kinetic energy operator of the $m_F=i$ state. The $2 N_\mathbf{k}$ term in this expression comes from the $N_\mathbf{k}$ atoms in the $m_F=1$ state with momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$ and the $N_\mathbf{k}$ atoms in the $m_F=0$ state with momentum $-\hbar \mathbf{k}$. Solving \eqref{Peaks:SimpleEnergyConservation} for the magnitude of the resonant wavenumber $\abs{\mathbf{k}}$ and neglecting the change in the condensate density so that $\abs{\psi'}^2\approx \abs{\Psi}^2$ gives
\begin{align}
    \abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}} &= \frac{1}{\hbar}\sqrt{2MU\abs{\Psi}^2\left(1-\kappa\right)}.
\end{align}


Generalising this argument to consider different density backgrounds $\Psi_i$ for the $m_F=1, 0$ states yields the wave number corresponding to the energy-momentum resonance of the scattered atoms as
\begin{align}
%    \abs{\mathbf{k}} &= \frac{1}{\hbar} \sqrt{2 M U \abs{\psi'}^2(1-\kappa)}
    \abs{\mathbf{k}_\text{res}} &= \frac{1}{\hbar} \sqrt{2 M U \big(2 \abs{\Psi_1}\abs{\Psi_0} - \abs{\Psi_1}^2 - \kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2\big)} \label{Peaks:ResonantWavenumber}.
\end{align}
This is a different expression to that obtained in the previous section \eqref{Peaks:BogResonantWavenumber}, as in this section it has been assumed that there is an equal density in both $m_F=1, 0$ excitations, an assumption not made in the previous section.

% The two expressions are equal when $\abs{\Psi_1}^2 = \kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2$ corresponding to no disturbance of the total mean field experienced by the $m_F=0$ state

%The resonant momentum for the gratings in the numerical simulations of $\unit[1.2\times 10^6]{m}^{-1}$ is in excellent agreement with the result given by \eqref{Peaks:ResonantWavenumber} of $\unit[1.3\times 10^6]{m}^{-1}$.
