\section{GP equations of motion for Peaks}
\label{DerivationsAppendix:PeaksGPEquationsOfMotion}

In this section goes a derivation of the scattering term (this isn't new), and the Penning ionisation term for the GP equation (new).

\section{TW equations of motion for Peaks}
\label{DerivationsAppendix:PeaksTWEquationsOfMotion}
This section is more important than the last and derives the noise term and Stratonovich correction for the Penning ionisation term for Truncated Wigner (new).
