The coherent atomic sources considered in this thesis cannot compete with the flux of present thermal sources.  They do, however, have two potentially significant advantages over thermal sources for atom interferometry.

The first is their narrower linewidth, and therefore velocity spread.  This enables more efficient operation of large momentum-transfer processes (which are highly velocity selective).  Large momentum-transfer processes are important for increasing the interaction time of the atoms, and therefore the phase shift to be measured.  Also, for larger interaction times the expansion of the atomic source increases signal loss \citep{Dimopoulos:2007uq}, an effect which is reduced by the use of a condensed source.

The second advantage of coherent sources is their potential for producing squeezed and entangled atomic sources.  In the context of quantum optics, squeezing has been used to reduce the shot noise limit (the standard quantum limit $\propto 1/\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of particles observed) in precision measurement by about a factor of 10\footnote{FIXME: Missing citations.}.  This is equivalent to an increase in the flux of the source of a factor of 100.  Entanglement has the possibility of even more dramatic improvements, however it relies on the creation of very fragile entangled sources.  The best that has been achieved in the context of quantum optics are entangled sources containing less than 10 photons \citep{Leibfried:2004}.  In the context of atom optics, squeezed atomic sources offer the possibility of increasing measurement sensitivity, while entangled sources are of greater interest for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

For the optical pumping mechanism considered in \chapterref{OpticalPumping}, the achievable flux of the atom laser is limited by the rate at which condensates can be produced to replace the source condensate as it is depleted.  Even if all of the atoms were transferred to the lasing condensate with perfect efficiency, the continuous atom laser produced could never exceed the average flux with which the source condensates can be produced.  The interesting property of this system, however, is that there is some intriguing evidence that the harmful reabsorption processes in that experiment may be suppressed due to a quantum-mechanical interference effect.  A better theoretical understanding of this process could enable the source condensate to be replaced with a thermal source.  If possible, this would greatly increase the potential flux of the produced atom laser, creating a competitive coherent atomic source for atom interferometry.

The evaporatively-driven pumping mechanism considered in \chapterref{KineticTheory}, is supplied by a thermal source and therefore it could be possible for it to provide a condensed source of atoms at a similar flux to the thermal source.  However, the actual flux is necessarily lower as the evaporation process removes atoms from the system as part of the pumping mechanism.  One of the aims of \chapterref{KineticTheory} was to determine just how much lower the flux of the condensed source would be.  It was found that the largest flux achievable from an available thermal atomic source was $\sim\unit[10^5]{s\textsuperscript{-1}}$, an average flux that is also achievable by producing independent condensates.

While neither of the proposed pumped atom lasers in their present forms would be competitive with thermal sources for atom interferometry, pumping could improve other atom laser experiments.  In particular, experiments in which squeezing or entanglement of atomic beams is being produced and measured.  In these experiments, the atomic beam will be condensed as it would be more difficult to detect squeezing or entanglement with a thermal source.  For these experiments, a pumped atom laser could potentially offer a narrower linewidth, increased flux, and continuous operation, all of which would increase the sensitivity of measurements of atomic squeezing and entanglement.

\chapterref{Peaks} discussed one such process that leads to the formation of entangled atomic beams.  Although in the experiment discussed in that chapter it would only be possible to measure number-difference squeezing and correlations in atom detection events, a different experiment was proposed in which it may be possible to measure the entanglement of the produced atomic beams.  This chapter has also demonstrated the excellent agreement that is achievable between theory and experiment for BEC systems.  This is possible due to extraordinary degree of control over external noise sources that is possible in experiments, and the effectiveness of the theoretical techniques available for modelling them.

This thesis documents the work of a theorist working, for the most part, in close collaboration with experimentalists.  This is particularly evident in \chapterref{Peaks} and \chapterref{OpticalPumping}, but it is also true for other work not documented here.  I have attempted to resolve the minor mysteries that sometimes arise in experimental physics by working closely with the experimentalists as they are discovered, cause confusion, and for the most part, resolved.

% Now for a strong finish.


% Contrary to what has been expected previously, this chapter has demonstrated that optical pumping of an atom laser is feasible without making the condensate so narrow as to make it essentially transparent in at least one dimension.  The next step in the investigation of this pumping process must be the theoretical consideration of the potential positive contribution of reabsorption.  When this is better understood, consideration can then be given to the integration of the pumping mechanism with a method for replacing the source condensates to produce a continuously pumped atom laser.
