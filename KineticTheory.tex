Pumping an atom laser, just like pumping an optical laser, is a necessarily irreversible process. In quantum mechanics, irreversibility enters through the coupling of a system to a large number of modes, known as a reservoir. Although, as quantum mechanics is symmetric under time-reversal, any process can be reversed by an appropriate unitary operation, such an operation can become impractical due to the large number of modes involved making such processes irreversible for all intents and purposes.

There are two choices of reservoir to provide the necessary irreversibility in pumping an atom laser: the electromagnetic and atomic modes. The former was considered in the previous chapter; the latter is the subject of this chapter. The results presented in this chapter have been submitted for publication\footnote{FIXME: Do this.}. The results and analysis presented in \sectionref{KineticTheory:Results} of this chapter was my own work. The model presented in \sectionref{KineticTheory:Model} is based on prior work \citep{Davis:2000vn,Bijlsma:2000}. The derivation of the three-body loss term in \sectionref{KineticTheory:3BodyLoss} and the code the results in this chapter are based on are the work of \emph{Matthew Davis}.

\section{Motivation}

Continuous pumping of an atom laser is a key tool for producing superior atomic sources. Besides the obvious benefit of higher flux, it also promises improved modal stability and linewidth, much as it does for the optical laser.

There are two essential steps towards the continuous pumping of an atom laser. The first is a delivery system for filling an atomic reservoir with ultracold atoms. The second is a process that causes at least some of those atoms to make an irreversible, atom-stimulated transition into the BEC.

Continuous delivery of ultracold atoms has been demonstrated in a number of experiments\footnote{FIXME: Add citations.}, and is an important component of thermal atomic interferometry experiments. FIXME: Complete paragraph.

The atom-stimulated transitions into the condensate can be made irreversible by coupling to a reservoir. There are two possible reservoirs: the empty modes of the electromagnetic field accessible via a transition from an excited atomic state, or the empty modes of the atomic field accessible via evaporation. Having considered the former in \chapterref{OpticalPumping} it is the latter under consideration in this chapter.

Sequential reloading of a target BEC was achieved using optical tweezers \citep{Chikkatur:2002qa}, where a series of source condensates were added adiabatically by manipulating the trapping potentials, and excitations were subsequently removed by continuous evaporation. This milestone experiment maintained the condensate fraction, and therefore the potential flux of a potential atom laser. An atom laser produced from such an experiment would, however, not possess the desired narrow linewidth as the source condensates used were of a similar size to or larger than the condensate being replenished causing significant scattering into modes other than the target condensate. To produce an atom laser with a narrow linewidth it would be necessary for the atomic source to negligibly disrupt the target condensate. While this could be achieved by merging the target condensate with significantly smaller condensates more frequently, it is technically very challenging to develop high flux sources of Bose-condensed atoms compared to sources at higher temperature, which have a higher average flux. In this chapter it is shown that a similar experiment using an ultra-cold \emph{thermal} source ought to be able to pump the target BEC and maintain a significant BEC population using a phase-preserving Bose-enhanced process.

%This method has the advantage that it can be performed without the presence of resonant light, but the obvious disadvantage that it relies on the system approaching thermal equilibrium, and will therefore be reversed by the addition of atoms above the condensate temperature. In this chapter it is demonstrated that a driven system undergoing evaporative cooling can produce a high-flux, phase-stable atom laser for a range of experimental parameters.

\section{Scheme}
\label{KineticTheory:Scheme}

    \label{KineticTheory:QKTScheme}
\end{figure}

The proposed scheme for a pumped atom laser is illustrated in \figureref{KineticTheory:QKTScheme}. Bose-enhanced scattering between the thermal atoms and the condensate drives atoms irreversibly into the condensate when one of the scattered atoms has enough energy to cross the evaporation surface and be removed from the thermal cloud. The thermal cloud is continuously replenished from a source of atoms at some temperature $T$. The atom laser is produced by large momentum-transfer Raman outcoupling from the condensate to minimise the loss from the atom laser as it traverses the evaporation surface\footnote{An alternative configuration would be to place the evaporation surface \emph{above} the thermal cloud, however the magnetic trap would need to be weak enough for the evaporation surface to be a large distance away from the centre of the magnetic trap. For a trapping frequency of $\omega = 2\pi \times \unit[100]{Hz}$ in the vertical direction, the separation between the centre of the condensate and the centre of the magnetic trap is $y_\text{sag} = \unit[25]{\micro m}$. In such traps, typical condensate sizes are $y_\text{TF} \sim \unit[10]{\micro m}$, not giving much space between the condensate and the thermal cloud. The effectiveness of the evaporation surface is reduced as its size is reduced. For this reason the evaporation surface in \figureref{KineticTheory:QKTScheme} has been pictured below the thermal cloud. FIXME: Rewrite last part of this footnote.}. Using large momentum-transfer Raman outcoupling also minimises the losses from the thermal cloud due to the outcoupling process itself.

In order to have net gain into the BEC mode while adding uncondensed atoms to the trap, the system must not be allowed to reach thermal equilibrium. If the thermal cloud is replenished from a source and the radio frequency `scalpel' that produces the forced evaporation is tuned so that atoms of energy $E_\text{cut}$ and higher are rapidly and continually removed from the trap, then the condensate will continually experience gain and loss as though it was in the middle of an evaporative step. As $E_\text{cut}$ is lowered, a larger fraction of the scattering processes that leave atoms in the condensate mode become irreversible. This suggests that there must be some value of $E_\text{cut}$ for which the condensate experiences net gain. What is not clear is whether the net gain can proceed efficiently, i.e. on a timescale much shorter than other losses from the condensate. Lowering $E_\text{cut}$ also reduces the total number of thermal atoms present. In the limit that $E_\text{cut}$ reaches the condensate energy, there will be no background gas at all, and the condensate cannot experience net gain. We therefore expect that for a given set of parameters, there will be an optimal value for $E_\text{cut}$ that maximises the net gain, which may or may not be positive. In order to examine this issue, we have employed quantum kinetic theory (QKT) \citep{Gardiner:1997tz,Jaksch:1997ug,Gardiner:1998wx,Jaksch:1998sj,Gardiner:2000ug,Lee:2000vs,Davis:2000vn}, which has been effective in describing the growth of condensates \citep{Davis:2000vn}.


\section{Model}
\label{KineticTheory:Model}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{QKTModel}
    \caption{Schematic of the theoretical model.}
    \label{KineticTheory:QKTModel}
\end{figure}

The starting point of QKT is to treat separately the condensed and thermal components of the system in \figureref{KineticTheory:QKTScheme}. The condensate is assumed to be an adiabatically-evolving Thomas-Fermi condensate fully described by the number of atoms in the condensate $N_0(t)$. The thermal cloud is assumed to be a classical gas described by its energy distribution function $g(\varepsilon, t)$ and the density of states $\rho(\varepsilon, t)$. The time-dependence of the density of states comes from the inclusion of the effect of the Hartree-Fock mean field of the condensate. The density of states is then fully determined by the trap geometry and the condensate number $N_0(t)$.

Following the method described in \citet{Bijlsma:2000}, the dynamics of the system are given by
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{d N_0}{d t} &= \left.\frac{d N_0}{d t}\right|_\text{thermal--condensate} + \left.\frac{d N_0}{d t}\right|_\text{3-body loss} + \left.\frac{d N_0}{d t}\right|_\text{outcoupling},\\
        \begin{split}
            \frac{\partial (\rho f)}{\partial t} &= \left.\frac{\partial (\rho f)}{\partial t}\right|_\text{thermal--thermal} + \left. \frac{\partial (\rho f)}{\partial t}\right|_\text{thermal--condensate} + \left.\frac{\partial (\rho f)}{\partial t}\right|_\text{3-body loss}\\
            &\relphantom{=} + \left. \frac{\partial (\rho f)}{\partial t}\right|_\text{redistribution} + \left. \frac{\partial (\rho f)}{\partial t}\right|_\text{replenishment}.
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}






In obtaining this model a number of assumptions are made:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Ergodic
    \item Adiabatic evolution of the condensate. This also applies at the evaporation cutoff.
    \item Neglect of the anomalous density
    \item Energy scales are such that all non-condensate excitations are particle-like not phonon-like (use of Hartree-Fock mean-field).
\end{enumerate}
These approximations are discussed at length in a comprehensive review article \citep{Proukakis:2008} in which the QKT formalism is referred to as the `ZNG' theory.


The fundamental starting point of quantum kinetic theory is the treatment of the thermal component in terms of a classical phase-space 

The fun

The quantum kinetic theory treats the thermal and condensed components separately. 


The fundamental starting point of QKT is the division of energy space in the trap into two regimes. Below $E_R$ there is a low energy regime that includes the condensate and low-lying excitations of the condensate, and above it the gas is treated by a classical kinetic theory. Initially $E_R$ is chosen arbitrarily, but when it is sufficiently high the results become independent of this division. Our model therefore has four important energy levels: $\mu$, the chemical potential of the replenished background gas; $\mu_0$, the chemical potential of the ground state of the BEC; $E_R$, the cutoff between the quantum description of the gas; and $E_\text{cut}$, the maximum energy of a trapped atom. These levels are shown schematically in blah.

Following the method of blah, we collect the quantum states between $\mu(0)$ and $E_R$ into bins such that...

The numerical method we use is based on that described in \citep{Bijlsma:2000}

% In the model section we will describe the equations and state them. There will be no derivation, with the exception of the three-body loss terms. The equations are derived in sufficient detail in \citep{Bijlsma:2000}. Code, and three-body loss terms derivation performed by \emph{Matthew Davis}.

\section{Results}
\label{KineticTheory:Results}
This is my contribution. Example simulations demonstrating time-dependence of the distributions, the dependence on $\eta$. Behaviour (and simple model) in the absence of three-body loss and why this is both obvious and unrealistic. Behaviour (and simple model in high-temperature limit) in the presence of three-body loss.

Joe has suggested that we not rely on the high-temperature limit, but I would really, really like to have that in.

\section{Conclusion}
Thermal sources must be close to degenerate to be useful.
