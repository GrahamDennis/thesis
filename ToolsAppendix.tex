This is an appendix in which we \emph{briefly} (hah!) summarise the features and methods of \texttt{xpdeint} with particular attention paid to those features used in this thesis. Of course appropriate acknowledgement must be made of \texttt{XMDS}. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectral method
    \item IP operator
    \item Various basis functions
    \item Coupled ODE-PDE systems
    \item Gaussian quadrature
    \item Stochastic integration
    \item Distributed simulations
    \item Cross-propagation
\end{itemize}
