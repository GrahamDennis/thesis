\section{Introduction / Motivation}

\section{Quantum Kinetic Theory Model}
In the model section we will describe the equations and state them. There will be no derivation, with the exception of the three-body loss terms. The equations are derived in sufficient detail in \citep{Bijlsma:2000}. Code, and three-body loss terms derivation performed by \emph{Matthew Davis}.

\section{Results}
This is my contribution. Example simulations demonstrating time-dependence of the distributions, the dependence on $\eta$. Behaviour (and simple model) in the absence of three-body loss and why this is both obvious and unrealistic. Behaviour (and simple model in high-temperature limit) in the presence of three-body loss.

Joe has suggested that we not rely on the high-temperature limit, but I would really, really like to have that in.

\section{Conclusion}
Thermal sources must be close to degenerate to be useful.
