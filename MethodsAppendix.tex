Some content goes here.

Perhaps this appendix might be called `technical details' or the like. And then we could cover things to keep an eye out for when doing simulations. Things like running off the edge of k-space causing phantom reflections, imaginary time algorithms. I could imagine quite a summary of techniques being possible.
