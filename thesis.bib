	Abstract = {We describe experimental setups for producing large Bose-Einstein condensates of 23Na and 87Rb. In both, a high-flux thermal atomic beam is decelerated by a Zeeman slower and is then captured and cooled in a magneto-optical trap. The atoms are then transferred into a cloverleaf-style Ioffe-Pritchard magnetic trap and cooled to quantum degeneracy with radio-frequency-induced forced evaporation. Typical condensates contain 20{\times}106 atoms. We discuss the similarities and differences between the techniques used for producing large 87Rb and 23Na condensates in the context of nearly identical setups},

	Abstract = {We present a compact 87Rb atomic source for high precision dual atom interferometers. The source is based on a double-stage magneto-optical trap (MOT) design, consisting of a two-dimensional (2D) -MOT for efficient loading of a 3D-MOT. The accumulated atoms are precisely launched in a horizontal moving molasses. Our source generates a high atomic flux (>1010  atoms/s) with precise and flexibly tunable atomic trajectories as required for high resolution Sagnac atom interferometry. We characterize the performance of the source with respect to the relevant parameters of the launched atoms, i.e., temperature, absolute velocity, and pointing, by utilizing time-of-flight techniques and velocity selective Raman transitions.},

The deceleration, caused by absorption of counterpropagating resonant laser light, amounts to 40% of the initial thermal velocity, corresponding to about 15 000 absorptions. Atoms were kept in resonance with the laser by using a spatially varying magnetic field to provide a changing Zeeman shift to compensate for the changing Doppler shift as the atoms decelerated.},

	Abstract = {The time evolution of species concentrations in biochemical reaction networks is often modeled using the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) [Gillespie, J. Phys. Chem. 81, 2340 (1977)]. The computational cost of the original SSA scaled linearly with the number of reactions in the network. Gibson and Bruck developed a logarithmic scaling version of the SSA which uses a priority queue or binary tree for more efficient reaction selection [Gibson and Bruck, J. Phys. Chem. A 104, 1876 (2000)]. More generally, this problem is one of dynamic discrete random variate generation which finds many uses in kinetic Monte Carlo and discrete event simulation. We present here a constant-time algorithm, whose cost is independent of the number of reactions, enabled by a slightly more complex underlying data structure. While applicable to kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in general, we describe the algorithm in the context of biochemical simulations and demonstrate its competitive performance on small- and medium-size networks, as well as its superior constant-time performance on very large networks, which are becoming necessary to represent the increasing complexity of biochemical data for pathways that mediate cell function},

	Abstract = {A central goal in condensed matter and modern atomic physics is the exploration of quantum phases of matter---in particular, how the universal characteristics of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions differ from those established for thermal phase transitions at non-zero temperature. Compared to conventional condensed matter systems, atomic gases provide a unique opportunity to explore quantum dynamics far from equilibrium. For example, gaseous spinor Bose--Einstein condensates1, 2, 3 (whose atoms have non-zero internal angular momentum) are quantum fluids that simultaneously realize superfluidity and magnetism, both of which are associated with symmetry breaking. Here we explore spontaneous symmetry breaking in 87Rb spinor condensates, rapidly quenched across a quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state. We observe the formation of spin textures, ferromagnetic domains and domain walls, and demonstrate phase-sensitive in situ detection of spin vortices. The latter are topological defects resulting from the symmetry breaking, containing non-zero spin current but no net mass current4.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the operation of an atom interferometer based on a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We strongly reduce the interaction induced decoherence that usually limits interferometers based on trapped condensates by tuning the s-wave scattering length almost to zero via a magnetic Feshbach resonance. We employ a 39K condensate trapped in an optical lattice, where Bloch oscillations are forced by gravity. The fine-tuning of the scattering length down to 0.1 a0 and the micrometric sizes of the atomic sample make our system a very promising candidate for measuring forces with high spatial resolution. Our technique can be in principle extended to other measurement schemes opening new possibilities in the field of trapped atom interferometry.},

	Abstract = {We present a joint theoretical and experimental study of the dynamical instability of a Bose---Einstein condensate at the band edge of a one-dimensional optical lattice. The instability manifests as rapid depletion of the condensate and conversion to a thermal cloud. We consider the collisional processes that can occur in such a system, and undertake a thorough theoretical study of the dynamical instability in systems of different dimensionality. We find spontaneous scattering is an important part of this process, and thus the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is unable to accurately predict the dynamics in this system. Our beyond mean-field approach, known as the truncated Wigner method, allows us to make quantitative predictions for the processes of parametric growth and heating that are observed in the laboratory, and we find good agreement with the experimental results.},

These quantities are calculated self-consistently using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations within the Popov approximation. Below the Bose-Einstein transition the excitation frequencies have a relatively weak temperature dependence even though the condensate is strongly depleted. As the condensate density goes to zero through the transition, the excitation frequencies are strongly affected and approach the frequencies of a noninteracting trapped gas in the high temperature limit.},

Results are generated for many temperatures by averaging over energy-weighted stochastic paths, each corresponding to a solution of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations with phase noise. The stochastic gauge method used relies on an off-diagonal coherent-state expansion, thus taking into account all quantum correlations. As an example, the second-order spatial correlation function and momentum distribution for an interacting 1D Bose gas are calculated.},

	Abstract = {We propose two distinct atom interferometer gravitational wave detectors, one terrestrial and another satellite based, utilizing the core technology of the Stanford 10 m atom interferometer presently under construction. Each configuration compares two widely separated atom interferometers run using common lasers. The signal scales with the distance between the interferometers, which can be large since only the light travels over this distance, not the atoms. The terrestrial experiment with two ~10 m atom interferometers separated by a ~1 km baseline can operate with strain sensitivity ~((10[sup -19])/(sqrt(Hz))) in the 1 Hz--10 Hz band, inaccessible to LIGO, and can detect gravitational waves from solar mass binaries out to megaparsec distances. The satellite experiment with two atom interferometers separated by a ~1000 km baseline can probe the same frequency spectrum as LISA with comparable strain sensitivity ~((10[sup -20])/(sqrt(Hz))). The use of ballistic atoms (instead of mirrors) as inertial test masses improves systematics coming from vibrations and acceleration noise, and significantly reduces spacecraft control requirements. We analyze the backgrounds in this configuration and discuss methods for controlling them to the required levels.},

	Abstract = {A Monte Carlo simulation of the atomic master equation for spontaneous emission in terms of atomic wave functions is developed. Realizations of the time evolution of atomic wave functions are constructed that correspond to an ensemble of atoms driven by laser light undergoing a sequence of spontaneous emissions. The atomic decay times are drawn according to the photon count distribution of the driven atom. Each quantum jump of the atomic electron projects the atomic wave function to the ground state of the atom. Our theory is based on a stochastic interpretation and generalization of Mollow's pure-state analysis of resonant light scattering, and the Srinivas-Davies theory of continuous measurements in photodetection. An extension of the theory to include mechanical light effects and a generalization to atomic systems with Zeeman substructure are given. We illustrate the method by simulating the solutions of the optical Bloch equations for two-level systems, and laser cooling of a two-level atom in an ion trap where the center-of-mass motion of the atom is described quantum mechanically.},

@unpublished{Krauth:2009,
	Abstract = {In my lectures at the Les Houches Summer School 2008, I discussed central concepts of computational statistical physics, which I felt would be accessible to the very cross-cultural audience at the school. 
I started with a discussion of sampling, which lies at the heart of the Monte Carlo approach. I specially emphasized the concept of perfect sampling, which offers a synthesis of the traditional direct and Markov-chain sampling approaches. The second lecture concerned classical hard-sphere systems, which illuminate the foundations of statistical mechanics, but also illustrate the curious difficulties that beset even the most recent simulations. I then moved on, in the third lecture, to quantum Monte Carlo methods, that underly much of the modern work in bosonic systems. Quantum Monte Carlo is an intricate subject. Yet one can discuss it in simplified settings (the single-particle free propagator, ideal bosons) and write direct-sampling algorithms for the two cases in two or three dozen lines of code only. These idealized algorithms illustrate many of the crucial ideas in the field. The fourth lecture attempted to illustrate aspects of the unity of physics as realized in the Ising model simulations of recent years. 
More details on what I discussed in Les Houches, and wrote up (and somewhat rearranged) here, can be found in my book, "Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations", as well as in recent papers. Computer programs are available for download and perusal at the book's web site www.smac.lps.ens.fr.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the dynamics of an open two-mode Bose-Hubbard system subject to phase noise and particle dissipation. Starting from the full many-body dynamics described by a master equation the mean-field limit is derived resulting in an effective non-hermitian (discrete) Gross-Pitaevskii equation which has been introduced only phenomenologically up to now. The familiar mean-field phase space structure is substantially altered by the dissipation. Especially the character of the fixed points shows an abrupt transition from elliptic or hyperbolic to attractiv or repulsive, respectively. This reflects the metastable behaviour of the corresponding many-body system which surprisingly also leads to a significant increase of the purity of the condensate. A comparison of the mean-field approximation to simulations of the full master equation using the Monte Carlo wave function method shows an excellent agreement for wide parameter ranges.},

	Abstract = {This thesis presents a new optical imaging technique which measures the structure of objects without the use of lenses. Termed diffraction-contrast imaging (DCI), the method retrieves the object structure from a Fresnel diffraction pattern of the object, using a deconvolution algorithm. DCI is particularly adept at imaging highly transparent objects and this is demonstrated by retrieving the structure of an almost transparent cloud of laser-cooled atoms. Applied to transparent Bose-Einstein condensates, DCI should allow the non-destructive imaging of the condensate while requiring only the minimum possible apparatus of a light source and a detector.

In this paper, we investigate the analog of cosmological particle creation in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe by numerically simulating a Bose-Einstein condensate with a time-dependent scattering length. In particular, we focus on a two-dimensional homogeneous condensate using the classical field method via the truncated Wigner approximation. We show that for various forms of the scaling function the particle production is consistent with the underlying theory in the long wavelength limit. In this context, we further discuss the implications of modified dispersion relations that arise from the microscopic theory of a weakly interacting Bose gas.},

In unstable condensates the excitation modes have complex frequencies. We derive the normalization conditions for unstable modes such that they can serve in a mode decomposition of the noncondensed component. Furthermore, we develop approximative techniques to determine the spectrum and the mode functions. Finally, we apply our theory to sonic horizons---sonic black and white holes. For sonic white holes the spectrum of unstable modes turns out to be intrinsically discrete, whereas black holes may be stable.},

	Abstract = {The dynamic structure factor of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensed gas is investigated at zero temperature in the framework of Bogoliubov theory. Different values of momentum transfer are considered, ranging from the phonon to the single-particle regime. Various approximate schemes are discussed, including the local density approximation, where the system is locally described as a uniform gas, and the impulse approximation, in which the response is fixed by the momentum distribution of the condensate. A comprehensive approach, based on the eikonal expansion, is presented. The predictions of theory are successfully compared with the results of recent two-photon Bragg scattering experiments, at both low and high momentum transfer. Relevant features of the dynamic structure factor are also discussed using the formalism of sum rules and the concept of scaling. Particular emphasis is given to the regime of high momentum transfer, in which the dynamic structure factor is sensitive to the behavior of the order parameter in momentum space, and some instructive examples showing the consequence of long-range coherence are presented.},

By assumption, the self-consistent condensate has a macroscopic occupation number N0{\gg}1, with N-N0≪N0. A linearized hydrodynamic description yields operator forms of the particle-conservation law and Bernoulli's theorem, expressed in terms of the small density fluctuation operator ρ^′ and velocity potential operator Φ^′, along with the condensate density n0 and velocity v0. For positive scattering length a and large stationary condensate (N0{\gg}d0/a and v0=0), the spherical condensate has a well-defined radius R0{\gg}d0, and the low-lying excited states are irrotational compressional waves localized near the surface. Approximate variational energies E0l of the lowest radial modes (n=0) for successive values of orbital angular momentum l form a rotational band given by E0l≊E00+1/2ħ2l(l+1)/mR02, with radial zero-point energy E00∝ħω(R0/d0)2/3=(ħ2 mω4R02)1/3. {\copyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

	Abstract = {This article reviews recent advances in the theory of the three-dimensional dilute homogeneous Bose gas at zero and finite temperature. Effective-field-theory methods are used to formulate a systematic perturbative framework that can be used to calculate the properties of a system at T=0. The perturbative expansion of these properties is essentially an expansion in the gas parameter sqrt[na3], where a is the s-wave scattering length and n is the number density. In particular, the leading quantum corrections to the ground-state energy density, the condensate depletion, and long-wavelength collective excitations are rederived in an efficient and economical manner. Nonuniversal effects are also discussed. These effects are higher-order corrections that depend on properties of the interatomic potential other than the scattering length, such as the effective range. The article critically examines various approaches to the dilute Bose gas in equilibrium at finite temperature. These include the Bogoliubov approximation, the Popov approximation, the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation, the Φ-derivable approach, optimized perturbation theory, and renormalization-group techniques. The article ends with a look at recent calculations of the critical temperature of the dilute Bose gas, which include 1/N techniques, lattice simulations, self-consistent calculations, and variational perturbation theory.},

	Abstract = {The density of states of a Bose-condensed gas confined in a harmonic trap is investigated. The predictions of Bogoliubov theory are compared with those of Hartree-Fock theory and of the hydrodynamic model. We show that the Hartree-Fock scheme provides an excellent description of the excitation spectrum in a wide range of energy, revealing a major role played by single-particle excitations in these confined systems. The crossover from the hydrodynamic regime, holding at low energies, to the independent-particle regime is explicitly explored by studying the frequency of the surface mode as a function of their angular momentum. The applicability of the semiclassical approximation for the excited states is also discussed. We show that the semiclassical approach provides simple and accurate formulas for the density of states and the quantum depletion of the condensate.},

@article{Hole:2009,
	Abstract = {In many magnetically confined fusion experiments, a significant fraction of the stored energy of the plasma resides in energetic, or non-thermal, particle populations. Despite this, most equilibrium treatments are based on MHD: a single fluid treatment which assumes a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function. Detailed magnetic reconstruction based on this treatment ignore the energetic complexity of the plasma and can result in model-data inconsistencies, such as thermal pressure profiles which are inconsistent with the total stored kinetic energy of the plasma. Alternatively, ad hoc corrections to the pressure profile, such as summing the energetic and thermal pressures, have poor theoretical justification. Motivated by this omission, we generalize ideal MHD one step further: we consider multiple quasi-neutral fluids, each in thermal equilibrium and each thermally insulated from each other--no population mixing occurs. Kinetically, such a model may be able to describe the ion or electron distribution function in regions of velocity phase space with a large number of particles, at the expense of more weakly populated phase space, which may have uncharacteristically high temperature and hence pressure. As magnetic equilibrium effects increase with the increase in pressure, our work constitutes an upper limit to the effect of energetic particles. When implemented into an existing solver, FLOW (Guazzotto et al 2004 Phys. Plasmas 11, 604-14), it becomes possible to qualitatively explore the impact of resolving the energetic populations on plasma equilibrium configurations in realistic geometry. Deploying the modified code, FLOW-M, on a high performance spherical torus configuration, we find that the effect of variations of the pressure, poloidal flow and toroidal flow of the energetic populations is qualitatively similar to variations in the background plasma. We also study the robustness of the equilibrium to uncertainties in the current profile and the energetic toroidal rotation or energetic pressure profile. For constant toroidal current and stored energy, the change in the poloidal flux with changes in the current profile is similar irrespective of whether the toroidal rotation or pressure was changed, indicating insensitivity to whether uncertainties lie in the pressure or toroidal rotation profiles. We conclude that to a first approximation, lumping the energetic and thermal fluids together, as is done for many equilibrium solvers, qualitatively produces correct results.},

	Abstract = {A method to create paired-atom laser beams from a metastable helium atom laser via four-wave mixing is demonstrated. Radio-frequency outcoupling is used to extract atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate near the center of the condensate and initiate scattering between trapped and untrapped atoms. The unequal strengths of the interactions for different internal states allows an energy-momentum resonance which leads to the creation of pairs of atoms scattered from the zero-velocity condensate. The resulting scattered beams are well separated from the main atom laser in the two-dimensional transverse atom laser profile. Numerical simulations of the system are in good agreement with the observed atom laser spatial profiles and indicate that the scattered beams are generated by a four-wave mixing process, suggesting that the beams are correlated.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a method for evolving the projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (PGPE) for a Bose gas in a harmonic oscillator potential. The central difficulty in solving this equation is the requirement that the classical field is restricted to a small set of prescribed modes that constitute the low energy classical region of the system. We present a scheme, using a Hermite-polynomial based spectral representation, that precisely implements this mode restriction and allows an efficient and accurate solution of the PGPE. We show equilibrium and nonequilibrium results from the application of the PGPE to an anisotropic trapped three-dimensional Bose gas.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~Modeling transverse vibration of nonlinear strings is investigated via numerical solutions of partial-differential equations and an integro-partial-differential equation. By averaging the tension along the deflected string, the classic nonlinear model of a transversely vibrating string, Kirchhoff‚{\"A}{\^o}s equation, is derived from another nonlinear model, a partial-differential equation. The partial-differential equation is obtained via neglecting longitudinal terms in a governing equation for coupled planar vibration. The finite difference schemes are developed to solve numerically those equations. An index is proposed to compare the transverse responses calculated from the two models with the transverse component calculated from the coupled equation. A steel string and a rubber string are treated as examples to demonstrate the differences between the two models of transverse vibration and their deviation from the full model of coupled vibration. The numerical results indicate that the differences increase with the amplitude of vibration. Both models yield satisfactory results of almost the same precision for vibration of small amplitudes. For large amplitudes, the Kirchhoff equation gives better results. },

This model, based on a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the electrostatic potential, accounts for the distribution of wave-packet shapes observed in the simulations, particularly the predominance of oblate wave packets. In contrast with predictions for undamped and undriven subsonic collapse of scalar fields, oblate vector-field wave packets do not flatten during collapse but, instead, remain approximately self-similar and rigid},

This essay presents a theoretical description of the superradiance phenomenon, in which both the quantal and the classical aspects are discussed. Starting from the simple two-level atom-small sample Dicke model, we successively introduce various complications inherent to a realistic superradiance experiment: effects of Van der Waals interaction between the atoms, propagation and diffraction of the electromagnetic field in the sample and finally the effects related to atomic level degeneracy or near degeneracy. We recall how to calculate the field radiated by a superradiant system in a single experiment and how to determine, for a series of identically prepared superradiant samples, the large shot to shot fluctuations of the emitted light properties. The presentation tries to unify various points of view and formalisms developed in previous works and to introduce simply and progressively the basic physical concepts relevant to the superradiance phenomenon.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a variable step size method for the numerical approximation of pathwise solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The method, which is dependent on a representation of Brownian paths as binary trees, involves estimation of local errors and of their contribution to the global error. We advocate controlling the variance of the one-step errors, conditional on knowledge of the Brownian path, in such a way that after propagation along the trajectory the error over each step will provide an equal contribution to the variance of the global error. Discretization schemes can be chosen that reduce the mean local error so that it is negligible beside the standard deviation. We show that to obtain convergence of variable step size methods for SDEs, in general it is not sufficient to evaluate the Brownian path only at the points in time where one tries to approximate the solution. We prove that convergence of such methods is guaranteed if the L{\'e}vy area is approximated well enough by further subdivision of the Brownian path and the discretization scheme employed uses appropriately both the approximate L{\'e}vy areas and increments of the Brownian path.},

	Abstract = { The pioneering work of Runge and Kutta a hundred years ago has ultimately led to suites of sophisticated numerical methods suitable for solving complex systems of deterministic ordinary differential equations. However, in many modelling situations, the appropriate representation is a stochastic differential equation and here numerical methods are much less sophisticated. In this paper a very general class of stochastic Runge-Kutta methods is presented and much more efficient classes of explicit methods than previous extant methods are constructed. In particular, a method of strong order 2 with a deterministic component based on the classical Runge-Kutta method is constructed and some numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.},

We will employ two different error estimation criteria for drift and diffusion terms of the equation, both of them based on forward and backward moves along the same time step. We will use step size selection mechanisms suitable for each of the two main regimes in the solution behavior, which correspond to domination of the drift-based local error estimator or diffusion-based one. Numerical experiments will show the effectiveness of this approach in the pathwise approximation of several standard test problems.},

	Abstract = {We study the interactions of a possibly dense and/or quantum degenerate gas with driving light. Both the atoms and the electromagnetic fields are represented by quantum fields throughout the analysis. We introduce a field-theory version of Markov and Born approximations for the interactions of light with matter, and devise a procedure whereby certain types of products of atom and light fields may be put to a desired, essentially normal, order. In the limit of low light intensity we find a hierarchy of equations of motion for correlation functions that contain one excited-atom field and one, three, five, etc., ground-state atom fields. It is conjectured that the entire linear hierarchy may be solved by solving numerically the classical equations for a coupled system of electromagnetic fields and charged harmonic oscillators. We discuss the emergence of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and collective linewidths, and delineate the limits of validity of the column density approach in terms of noncooperative atoms by presenting a mathematical example in which this approach is exact.},

	Abstract = {We derive the dispersion relation for the propagation of quasiresonant light with frequency ωL in an ultracold gas of bosonic atoms in the dilute regime, i.e., for an atomic density ρ0≪(ωL/c)3. In our calculation, valid up to order 2 in density, two types of corrections to the Lorentz-Lorenz formula for the refractive index appear. The first one is due to the bosonic nature of the atoms and its contribution is related to the two-body correlation function. The second correction originates from multiple scattering of photons within pairs of close atoms, giving rise to the resonant van der Waals interaction. The temperature dependence of the refractive index gives a clear signature of quantum statistical effects, even if the degeneracy threshold for Bose-Einstein condensation is not reached.},

We give a brief survey of the area focusing on a number of application areas where approximations to strong solutions are important, with a particular focus on computational biology applications, and give the necessary analytical tools for understanding some of the important concepts associated with stochastic processes. We present the stochastic Taylor series expansion as the fundamental mechanism for constructing effective numerical methods, give general results that relate local and global order of convergence and mention the Magnus expansion as a mechanism for designing methods that preserve the underlying structure of the problem. We also present various classes of explicit and implicit methods for strong solutions, based on the underlying structure of the problem. Finally, we discuss implementation issues relating to maintaining the Brownian path, efficient simulation of stochastic integrals and variable-step-size implementations based on various types of control.},

	Abstract = {Abstract~~The development of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations has intensified over the past decade. The earliest methods were usually heuristic adaptations of deterministic methods, but were found to have limited accuracy regardless of the order of the original scheme. A stochastic counterpart of the Taylor formula now provides a framework for the systematic investigation of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations. It suggests numerical schemes, which involve multiple stochastic integrals, of higher order of convergence. We shall survey the literature on these and on the earlier schemes in this paper. Our discussion will focus on diffusion processes, but we shall also indicate the extensions needed to handle processes with jump components. In particular, we shall classify the schemes according to strong or weak convergence criteria, depending on whether the approximation of the sample paths or of the probability distribution is of main interest.},

High-order numerical methods are developed for the integration of stochastic differential equations with strong solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting integration schemes by computing the errors in approximate solutions for SDE's which have known exact solutions.},

	Abstract = {Cold atoms in optical lattices provide a unique laboratory for investigating quantum phase transitions between strongly correlated superfluid and Mott insulator phases1, 2. One of the major bottlenecks in the analysis of experiments is a clear set of criteria for identifying the superfluid phase3. A 'sharp' interference pattern in time-of-flight experiments has been widely adopted as a signature of superfluidity4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Here, we show that sharp peaks are not a reliable diagnostic of superfluidity. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Bose--Hubbard model in three dimensions with up to N=1.4104 particles, we calculate the momentum distribution n(k) as a function of temperature T and t/U, the ratio of hopping to the onsite repulsion. We find that even above the transition temperature Tc where both superfluid density and condensate fraction vanish, the interference pattern can nevertheless have sharp peaks riding over a broad background. We identify the true signature of the superfluid and give a deeper understanding of why such sharp peaks appear in the normal state.},

	Abstract = {We measured the Newtonian constant of gravity, G, using a gravity gradiometer based on atom interferometry. The gradiometer measures the differential acceleration of two samples of laser-cooled Cs atoms. The change in gravitational field along one dimension is measured when a well-characterized Pb mass is displaced. Here, we report a value of G = 6.693 x 10-11 cubic meters per kilogram second squared, with a standard error of the mean of {+/-}0.027 x 10-11 and a systematic error of {+/-}0.021 x 10-11 cubic meters per kilogram second squared. The possibility that unknown systematic errors still exist in traditional measurements makes it important to measure G with independent methods.

The beam becomes squeezed due to nonlinear interactions between the atoms in the beam in an analogue to optical Kerr squeezing.

Finally we show that significant squeezing can be obtained in an experimentally realistic system and suggest ways of increasing the tunability of the squeezing.},

This state displays spontaneously broken cylindrical symmetry. This behavior is reflected in the excitation spectrum: As we approach the phase transition point, the lowest excitation frequency goes to zero, indicating the onset of instability in the density profile. Following the phase transition, this frequency rises again.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the characteristics of an atom laser created by removing atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) via a two-photon Raman process. In contrast with outcoupling by RF transitions, Raman outcoupling offers spatial selectivity within the condensate and delivers significant momentum transfer to the outcoupled atoms. We develop a version of zero-temperature mean-field theory for BECs which includes the internal state of the atom and the effect of laser fields focused into the cloud. For a model condensate we find that the outcoupled matter wave develops sharp peaks at spatial positions where the two-photon Raman process is resonant with the hyperfine splitting of the atomic ground state. As time proceeds the width of the outcoupled wave expands and a steady stream of matter waves travels outside the condensate volume.},

	Abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate increased diffuse transmission of light through strongly scattering materials. Wave front shaping is used to selectively couple light to the open transport eigenchannels, specific solutions of Maxwell's equations which the sample transmits fully, resulting in an increase of up to 44% in the total angle-integrated transmission compared to the case where plane waves are incident. The results for each of several hundreds of experimental runs are in excellent quantitative agreement with random matrix theory. From our measurements we conclude that with perfectly shaped wave fronts the transmission of a disordered sample tends to a universal value of 2/3, regardless of the thickness.},

We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of 10 for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wave function shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit.},

	Abstract = {Single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL1, 2, 3, 4, 5) results from the extreme temperatures and pressures achieved during bubble compression; calculations have predicted6, 7 the existence of a hot, optically opaque plasma core8 with consequent bremsstrahlung radiation9, 10. Recent controversial reports11, 12 claim the observation of neutrons from deuterium--deuterium fusion during acoustic cavitation11, 12. However, there has been previously no strong experimental evidence for the existence of a plasma during single- or multi-bubble sonoluminescence. SBSL typically produces featureless emission spectra13 that reveal little about the intra-cavity physical conditions or chemical processes. Here we report observations of atomic (Ar) emission and extensive molecular (SO) and ionic (O2+) progressions in SBSL spectra from concentrated aqueous H2SO4 solutions. Both the Ar and SO emission permit spectroscopic temperature determinations, as accomplished for multi-bubble sonoluminescence with other emitters14, 15, 16. The emissive excited states observed from both Ar and O2+ are inconsistent with any thermal process. The Ar excited states involved are extremely high in energy (>13 eV) and cannot be thermally populated at the measured Ar emission temperatures (4,000--15,000 K); the ionization energy of O2 is more than twice its bond dissociation energy, so O2+ likewise cannot be thermally produced. We therefore conclude that these emitting species must originate from collisions with high-energy electrons, ions or particles from a hot plasma core.},

We show here that these flashes, which comprise over 105 photons, are too fast to be resolved by the fastest photomultiplier tubes available. Furthermore, when sonoluminescence is driven by a resonant sound field, the bursts can occur in a continuously repeating, regular fashion. These precise 'clock-like' emissions can continue for hours at drive frequencies ranging from audible to ultrasonic. These bursts represent an amplification of energy by eleven orders of magnitude},

@article{Brenner:2002,
	Abstract = {Single-bubble sonoluminescence occurs when an acoustically trapped and periodically driven gas bubble collapses so strongly that the energy focusing at collapse leads to light emission. Detailed experiments have demonstrated the unique properties of this system: the spectrum of the emitted light tends to peak in the ultraviolet and depends strongly on the type of gas dissolved in the liquid; small amounts of trace noble gases or other impurities can dramatically change the amount of light emission, which is also affected by small changes in other operating parameters (mainly forcing pressure, dissolved gas concentration, and liquid temperature). This article reviews experimental and theoretical efforts to understand this phenomenon. The currently available information favors a description of sonoluminescence caused by adiabatic heating of the bubble at collapse, leading to partial ionization of the gas inside the bubble and to thermal emission such as bremsstrahlung. After a brief historical review, the authors survey the major areas of research: Section II describes the classical theory of bubble dynamics, as developed by Rayleigh, Plesset, Prosperetti, and others, while Sec. III describes research on the gas dynamics inside the bubble. Shock waves inside the bubble do not seem to play a prominent role in the process. Section IV discusses the hydrodynamic and chemical stability of the bubble. Stable single-bubble sonoluminescence requires that the bubble be shape stable and diffusively stable, and, together with an energy focusing condition, this fixes the parameter space where light emission occurs. Section V describes experiments and models addressing the origin of the light emission. The final section presents an overview of what is known, and outlines some directions for future research.},

	Abstract = {The kinetic energy of an atom recoiling due to absorption of a photon was measured as a frequency, using an interferometric technique called ``contrast interferometry.'' Optical standing wave pulses were used to create a symmetric three-path interferometer with a Bose-Einstein condensate. Its recoil phase, measurable with a single shot, varies quadratically with additional recoils and is insensitive to errors from vibrations and ac Stark shifts. We have measured the photon recoil frequency of sodium to 7 ppm precision, using a simple realization of this scheme. Plausible extensions should yield sufficient precision to attain a ppb-level determination of h/m and the fine structure constant α.},

@article{Valentine:2008,
	Abstract = {Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that have properties, such as a negative refractive index1, 2, 3, 4, not attainable with naturally occurring materials. Negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) were first demonstrated for microwave frequencies5, 6, but it has been challenging to design NIMs for optical frequencies and they have so far been limited to optically thin samples because of significant fabrication challenges and strong energy dissipation in metals7, 8. Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two-dimensional waveguide9. Three-dimensional (3D) optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a 3D magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction10, 11. Here we report a 3D optical metamaterial having negative refractive index with a very high figure of merit of 3.5 (that is, low loss). This metamaterial is made of cascaded 'fishnet' structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical NIM to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Bulk optical metamaterials open up prospects for studies of 3D optical effects and applications associated with NIMs and zero-index materials such as reversed Doppler effect, superlenses, optical tunnelling devices12, 13, compact resonators and highly directional sources14.},

	Abstract = {A simple method to create paired atom laser beams from a metastable helium atom laser via four-wave mixing is demonstrated. Radio frequency outcoupling is used to outcouple atoms from a Bose Einstein condensate near the center of the condensate and initiate scattering between trapped and untrapped atoms. The unequal strengths of the interactions for different internal states allows an energy resonance for the creation of pairs of atoms scattered from the zero-velocity condensate. The resulting scattered beams are well separated from the main atom laser in the 2-dimensional transverse atom laser profile. Numerical simulations of the system are in good agreement with the observed atom laser spatial profiles, and verify that the scattered beams are generated by a four-wave mixing process, suggesting that the beams are correlated.},

@article{Reichenbach:2007,
	Abstract = {Biodiversity is essential to the viability of ecological systems. Species diversity in ecosystems is promoted by cyclic, non-hierarchical interactions among competing populations. Central features of such non-transitive relations are represented by the 'rock--paper--scissors' game, in which rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper wraps rock. In combination with spatial dispersal of static populations, this type of competition results in the stable coexistence of all species and the long-term maintenance of biodiversity1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, population mobility is a central feature of real ecosystems: animals migrate, bacteria run and tumble. Here, we observe a critical influence of mobility on species diversity. When mobility exceeds a certain value, biodiversity is jeopardized and lost. In contrast, below this critical threshold all subpopulations coexist and an entanglement of travelling spiral waves forms in the course of time. We establish that this phenomenon is robust; it does not depend on the details of cyclic competition or spatial environment. These findings have important implications for maintenance and temporal development of ecological systems and are relevant for the formation and propagation of patterns in microbial populations or excitable media.},

In analogy to quantum optics, the process can also be thought of as spontaneous, degenerate four-wave mixing of de Broglie waves. We find a clear correlation between atoms with opposite momenta, demonstrating pair production in the scattering process. We also observe a Hanbury Brown--Twiss correlation for collinear momenta, which permits an independent measurement of the size of the pair production source and thus the size of the spatial mode. The back-to-back pairs occupy very nearly two oppositely directed spatial modes, a promising feature for future quantum optics experiments.},

	Abstract = {I derive the quantum phase-noise limit to the sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in which the incident quantum particles enter via both input ports. I show that if the incident particles are entangled and correlated properly, then the phase sensitivity scales asymptotically like the Heisenberg-limited Δφ=O(1/N), for large N, where N is the number of particles incident per unit time. (In a one-input-port device, the sensitivity can be at best Δφ=1/sqrt[N].) My calculation applies to bosons or fermions of arbitrary integer or half-integer spin. Applications to optical, atom-beam, and atom-laser gyroscopes are discussed---in particular, an atom-laser can be used to obtain the required entanglements for achieving this Heisenberg-limited sensitivity with atomic matter waves.},

Radiative recombination of the negatively charged trion in a single quantum dot leaves behind a single electron. We show that in two regions of vertical electric field, the electron hybridizes with a continuum through a tunneling interaction. The hybridization manifests itself through an unusual voltage dependence of the emission energy and a non-Lorentzian line shape, features which we reproduce with a theory based on the Anderson Hamiltonian.},

@article{Donley:2001,
	Abstract = {When atoms in a gas are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they will---under the appropriate conditions---condense into a single quantum-mechanical state known as a Bose--Einstein condensate. In such systems, quantum-mechanical behaviour is evident on a macroscopic scale. Here we explore the dynamics of how a Bose--Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing its size and shape is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the interatomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally applied magnetic field yields detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wavefunction and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. All these processes have curious dependences on time, on the strength of the interaction and on the number of condensate atoms. Although the system would seem to be simple and well characterized, our measurements reveal many phenomena that challenge theoretical models.},

	Abstract = {The point of instability of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) due to attractive interactions was studied. Stable 85Rb BECs were created and then caused to collapse by slowly changing the atom-atom interaction from repulsive to attractive using a Feshbach resonance. At a critical value, an abrupt transition was observed in which atoms were ejected from the condensate. By measuring the onset of this transition as a function of number and attractive interaction strength, we determined the stability condition to be N|a| / aho  =  0.459$\pm$0.012$\pm$0.054, slightly lower than the predicted value of 0.574.},

	Abstract = {I present and discuss a model for the free-for-all passenger boarding which is employed by some discount air carriers. The model is based on the principles of statistical mechanics where each seat in the aircraft has an associated binding energy which reflects the preferences of the population of air travelers. As each passenger enters the airplane they select their seats using Boltzmann statistics, proceed to that location, load their luggage, sit down, and the partition function seen by remaining passengers is modified to reflect this fact. I discuss the various model parameters and make qualtitative comparisons of this passenger boarding model with models which involve assigned seats. This model may be of value to industry professional as a useful description of this boarding method. However, it also has significant value as a pedagogical tool since it is a relatively unusual application of undergraduate level physics and it describes a situation with which many students and faculty may be familiar.},

	Abstract = {We introduce an approximate phase-space technique to simulate the quantum dynamics of interacting bosons. With the future goal of treating Bose-Einstein condensate systems, the method is designed for systems with a natural separation into highly occupied (condensed) modes and lightly occupied modes. The method self-consistently uses the Wigner representation to treat highly occupied modes and the positive-P representation for lightly occupied modes. In this method, truncation of higher-derivative terms from the Fokker-Planck equation is usually necessary. However, at least in the cases investigated here, the resulting systematic error, over a finite time, vanishes in the limit of large Wigner occupation numbers. We tested the method on a system of two interacting anharmonic oscillators, with high and low occupations, respectively. The Hybrid method successfully predicted atomic quadratures to a useful simulation time 60 times longer than that of the positive-P method. The truncated Wigner method also performed well in this test. For the prediction of the correlation in a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, for this same system, the Hybrid method gave excellent agreement with the exact result, while the truncated Wigner method showed a large systematic error.},

	Abstract = {We compare four-wave mixing in quantum degenerate gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We find that matter-wave gratings formed from either bosonic or fermionic atoms can in principle exhibit nearly identical Bragg scattering and four-wave mixing properties. This implies that effects such as coherent matter-wave amplification and superradiance can occur in degenerate Fermi gases. This effect is due to constructive many-particle quantum interferences, which in the boson case are interpreted as ``Bose enhancement.''},

For a gas of large extent the effect of photon recoil momentum on coherence is calculated. The effect of a radiation pulse in exciting "super-radiant" states is discussed. The angular correlation between successive photons spontaneously emitted by a gas initially in thermal equilibrium is calculated.},

Two energy-time entangled photons are sent through optical fibers and directed into unbalanced interferometers at two receiving stations separated by 18 km. At each station, the detection of a photon triggers the displacement of a macroscopic mass. The timing ensures space-like separation from the moment a photon enters its interferometer until the mass has moved. 2-photon interference fringes with a visibility of up to 90.5% are obtained, leading to a violation of Bell inequality.},

The evolution of phase coherence between different regions of the sample is constantly monitored and information on the spatial first-order correlation function is obtained. We observe the growth of the spatial coherence and the formation of long-range order in real time and compare it to the growth of the atomic density. Moreover, we study the evolution of the momentum distribution during the nonequilibrium formation of the condensate.},

In this paper we propose a method for loading atoms into the thermal component of a Bose condensed cloud confined in a magnetic trap. This method is aimed at allowing steady-state dynamics to be achieved. The proposed scheme involves loading atoms into the conservative magnetic potential using the spontaneous emission of photons. We show that the probability for the reabsorption of these photons may be small.},

	Abstract = {We present a general formalism for describing stimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a multi-level atom. The atom is assumed to have two ground state manifolds a and b and an excited state manifold e, and the adiabatic passage is carried out by resonantly driving the a-e and b-e transitions with time-dependent fields. Our formalism gives a complete description of the adiabatic passage process, and can be applied to systems with arbitrary numbers of degenerate states in each manifold and arbitrary couplings of the a-e and b-e transitions. We illustrate the formalism by applying it to both a simple toy model and to adiabatic passage in the Cesium atom.},

It is shown that by using a resonant cavity of centimeter dimensions, having many resonant modes, maser oscillation at these wavelengths can be achieved by pumping with reasonable amounts of incoherent light. For wavelengths much shorter than those of the ultraviolet region, maser-type amplification appears to be quite impractical. Although use of a multimode cavity is suggested, a single mode may be selected by making only the end walls highly reflecting, and defining a suitably small angular aperture. Then extremely monochromatic and coherent light is produced. The design principles are illustrated by reference to a system using potassium vapor.},

	Abstract = {The linewidth of an atom laser can be limited by excitation of higher energy modes in the source Bose-Einstein condensate, energy shifts in that condensate due to the atomic interactions, or phase diffusion of the lasing mode due to those interactions. The first two are effects that can be described with a semiclassical model, and have been studied in detail for both pumped and unpumped atom lasers. The third is a purely quantum statistical effect and has been studied only in zero-dimensional models. We examine an unpumped atom laser in one dimension using a quantum field theory using stochastic methods based on the truncated Wigner approach. This allows spatial and statistical effects to be examined simultaneously, and the linewidth limit for unpumped atom lasers is quantified in various limits.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the linewidth of a quasicontinuous atom laser within a semiclassical framework. In the high flux regime, the lasing mode can exhibit a number of undesirable features such as density fluctuations. We show that the output therefore has a complicated structure that can be somewhat simplified using Raman outcoupling methods and energy-momentum selection rules. In the weak outcoupling limit, we find that the linewidth of an atom laser is instantaneously Fourier limited, but, due to the energy ``chirp'' associated with depletion of the condensate, the long-term linewidth of an atom laser is equivalent to the chemical potential of the condensate source. We show that correctly sweeping the outcoupling frequency can recover the Fourier-limited linewidth.},

The difference between our value for g and one obtained by a falling corner-cube optical interferometer is (7 +- 7) x 10[?]9 g. The atom interferometer uses velocity-selective stimulated Raman transitions and laser-cooled caesium atoms in an atomic fountain.

	Abstract = {We report the demonstration of a sensitive absolute-gravity gradiometer based on light-pulse atom-interference techniques. The gradiometer consists of two absolute accelerometers operated in a differential mode. We report a differential acceleration sensitivity of 4{\times}10-9g/Hz1/2 and an inferred differential acceleration accuracy of less than 10-9g. This corresponds to a gravity-gradient sensitivity of 4E/Hz1/2 (1E=10-9 s-2) and an accuracy of better than 1E for a 10-m separation between accelerometers. We demonstrate that the instrument can be used to detect nearby masses in a vibrationally noisy environment and characterize instrument sensitivity to spurious acceleration and rotation noise.},

Atoms are initially spin polarized and cooled to the ground state of the optical potential using 3D Raman sideband cooling and then accelerated in the lattice to velocities of up to 3 m/s. Subsequent adiabatic lowering of the potential releases the atoms from the lattice. Three-dimensional kinetic temperatures as low as 200 nK were achieved. The observed temperature of the launch is independent of the acceleration and final velocity of the atoms. In an alternative approach, we first accelerate the atoms to velocities of up to 5 m/s using moving molasses and then cool them with the lattice in the comoving frame of the atoms to temperatures as low as 150 nK.},

	Abstract = {Coherent matter waves in the form of Bose--Einstein condensates have led to the development of nonlinear and quantum atom optics --- the de Broglie wave analogues of nonlinear and quantum optics with light. In nonlinear atom optics, four-wave mixing of matter waves and mixing of combinations of light and matter waves have been observed; such progress culminated in the demonstration of phase-coherent matter-wave amplification. Solitons represent another active area in nonlinear atom optics: these non-dispersing propagating modes of the equation that governs Bose--Einstein condensates have been created experimentally, and observed subsequently to break up into vortices. Quantum atom optics is concerned with the statistical properties and correlations of matter-wave fields. A first step in this area is the measurement of reduced number fluctuations in a Bose--Einstein condensate partitioned into a series of optical potential wells.},

	Abstract = {The precision in spectroscopy of any quantum system is fundamentally limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for energy and time. For N systems, this limit requires that they be in a quantum-mechanically entangled state. We describe a scalable method of spectroscopy that can potentially take full advantage of entanglement to reach the Heisenberg limit and has the practical advantage that the spectroscopic information is transferred to states with optimal protection against readout noise. We demonstrate our method experimentally with three beryllium ions. The spectroscopic sensitivity attained is 1.45(2) times as high as that of a perfect experiment with three non-entangled particles.

This intriguing class of wave packets, initially predicted by Berry and Balazs in 1979, has been realized in both one- and two-dimensional configurations. As demonstrated in our experiments, these Airy beams can exhibit unusual features such as the ability to remain diffraction-free over long distances while they tend to freely accelerate during propagation},

@article{Rehler:1971,
	Abstract = {We introduce a straightforward quantum-electrodynamic approach to the problem of superradiant spontaneous emission from a system of two-level atoms, and also discuss two classical superradiant systems. The same physical concepts underlie our treatment of both the quantum and classical cases. Explicit expressions are found which describe the time evolution and directional character of the radiated power. Our approach applies to an arbitrary number of atoms which are confined to a region with linear dimensions which may be large compared with the mean wavelength of the emitted radiation. The radiative decay half-life of a large many-atom system is found to be much shorter than the natural lifetime of a single atom, but not as short as the half-life of a small atomic system with the same number of atoms. The far-field radiation pattern appropriate to the case of a circular cylinder of emitters which have been excited by a plane-wave pulse is considered in detail. Polar plots are presented of the radiation patterns produced when the atoms are excited by a plane-wave pulse. Exciting pulses traveling in directions both parallel and at an angle of 10$\,^{\circ}$ to the axis of the cylinder are considered. A discussion and generalization of Dicke's "coherence-brightening" criterion is given.},

Atomic Bose-Einstein condensates inside light-induced periodic potentials (optical lattices) share many features with electrons in solids, but also with light waves in nonlinear materials and other nonlinear systems. Generally, atom-atom interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates lead to rich and interesting nonlinear effects. Furthermore, the experimental control over the parameters of the periodic potential and the condensate make it possible to enter regimes inaccessible in other systems. In this review, an introduction to the physics of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices is given and an overview of the theoretical and experimental advances to date.},

@article{Anglin:2002,
	Abstract = {The early experiments on Bose--Einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases accomplished three long-standing goals. First, cooling of neutral atoms into their motional ground state, thus subjecting them to ultimate control, limited only by Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. Second, creation of a coherent sample of atoms, in which all occupy the same quantum state, and the realization of atom lasers --- devices that output coherent matter waves. And third, creation of a gaseous quantum fluid, with properties that are different from the quantum liquids helium-3 and helium-4. The field of Bose--Einstein condensation of atomic gases has continued to progress rapidly, driven by the combination of new experimental techniques and theoretical advances. The family of quantum-degenerate gases has grown, and now includes metastable and fermionic atoms. Condensates have become an ultralow-temperature laboratory for atom optics, collisional physics and many-body physics, encompassing phonons, superfluidity, quantized vortices, Josephson junctions and quantum phase transitions.},

@article{Cornell:2002,
	Abstract = {Bose-Einstein condensation, or BEC, has a long and rich history dating from the early 1920s. In this article we will trace briefly over this history and some of the developments in physics that made possible our successful pursuit of BEC in a gas. We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this discussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of: How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? Did you know it was going to work? How long did it take you and why? We will review some our favorites from among the experiments we have carried out with BEC. There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what makes BEC in a dilute gas so interesting, unique, and experimentally challenging.1},

A single two-photon coupling pulse prepares the double-condensate system with a well-defined relative phase; at a later time, a second pulse reads out the phase difference accumulated between the two condensates. We find that the accumulated phase difference reproduces from realization to realization of the experiment, even after the individual components have separated spatially and their relative center-of-mass motion has damped.},

We present results from the two consistent theories developed so far.

A beam of thermal atoms (bosons) in a metastable atomic state is pumped into a multimode atomic cavity. This cavity is coupled through spontaneous emission to another cavity for the atomic ground state. Above a certain threshold pumping rate a large number of atoms build up in the lowest energy state of the second cavity, while the higher energy states remain unpopulated. Atoms are then coupled to the outside of the cavity with a Raman transition. This changes the internal level of the atom and imparts a momentum kick, allowing the atoms to leave the system. We propose an implementation of our scheme using hollow optical-fiber atom waveguides.},

The resonators are blue-detuned optical dipole-force traps, which can be loaded continuously or repetitively with laser-cooled atoms. This is achieved by trapping the atoms in a different internal state than that used for laser cooling. The transfer of cold atoms into the trapped states involves emission of a photon and can be stimulated by the presence of identical bosonic atoms in the final atomic state. Numerical simulations show threshold behaviour, mode competition and Poissonian atom statistics above threshold.},

That is to say, an atom laser field would have a well defined number of atoms, and a slow rate of phase diffusion. Here we consider an atom laser model recently proposed by Holland et al, based on evaporative cooling of atoms. We extend their model, and give approximate analytical results for the time-dependent intensity and phase statistics of the atom laser in different regimes. Although the intensity fluctuations may be relatively small, the laser linewidth is always in excess of the bare linewidth of the laser mode. Nevertheless, in one regime (weak collisions), the laser linewidth may be less than the output flux of atoms, which is a minimum requirement for considering the output to be coherent.},

@article{Bergeman:1989,
	Abstract = {We consider quantized motion of neutral atoms cooled below the recoil limit in a quadrupole magnetostatic trap. Because of Majorana transitions to untrapped levels near the point of zero field at the trap center, all quantum levels have a nonzero decay rate. The Schr{\"o}dinger equation associated with the potential g \mu B . S (S is the total atomic spin) takes the form of coupled equations in r when the spinor components are expanded in spherical harmonics. We integrate the multichannel problem numerically to obtain asymptotic phase shifts, resonance energies, and widths. For S = 1/2, the lowest levels have widths somewhat less than their spacing. Thus the trap quantum-level structure might possibly be observable if the atoms are sufficiently cold, namely, in the 0.1-\mu K regime for most atoms and attainable trap field graidents. The width decreases rapidly with increasing M_J, the angular momentum about the symmetry axis. Spectroscopic linewidths of a few hertz are possible if there is enough population in the lowest levels with a few M_J quanta. The decay rate of the lowest levels, however, is probably too rapid for studying Bose-Einstein condensation in such a trap.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical results from solving the time-dependent nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (NLSE) that describes an inhomogeneous, weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a small harmonic trap potential at zero temperature. With this method we are able to find solutions for the NLSE for ground state condensate wave functions in one dimension or in three dimensions with spherical symmetry. These solutions corroborate previous ground state results obtained from the solution of the time-independent NLSE. Furthrmore, we can examine the time evolution of the macroscopic wave function even when the trap potential is changed on a time scale comparable to that of the condensate dynamics, a situation that can be easily achieved in magneto-optical traps. We show that there are stable solutions for atomic species with both positive and negative s-wave scattering lengths in one-dimensional (1D) and 3D systems for a fixed number of atoms. In both the 1D and 3D cases, these negative scattering length solutions have solitonlike properties. In 3D, however, these solutions are only stable for a modest range of nonlinearities. We analyze the prospects for diagnosing Bose-Einstein condensation in a trap using several experiments that exploit the time-dependent behavior of the condensate.},

The rate constants for both elastic and inelastic processes were found to be particularly sensitive to the short-range 5Σg+ molecular potential and, to a lesser extent, the rate constants for relaxation-induced Penning ionization displayed sensitivity to the short-range form of the 1Σg+ molecular potential and the autoionization width.},

@article{Morris:1964,
	Abstract = {In experiments reported elsewhere, adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) has been performed on multilevel electron-paramagnetic crystals having three equally spaced energy levels separated by ℏω0. All transitions among the three levels are allowed due to crystalline electric-field mixing of the pure spin states. Simultaneous ARP inversion of the two coincident transitions at ω0 produces a negative temperature simultaneously on all three transitions, at ω0 and 2ω0. The present paper explains these results through an analysis of adiabatic rapid passage in a spin system having an arbitrary spin-Hamiltonian with three equally spaced energy levels. Previous treatments of ARP have been limited either to the multilevel case with pure spin states or to the two-level case with mixed states. In the present analysis, the 3{\times}3 density matrix is transformed to an equivalent matrix whose equation of motion contains a Hamiltonian which is real and constant, even with the rf perturbation applied. The transformed matrix is expanded in terms of nine orthonormal Hermitian basis matrices. Three of the expansion coefficients are directly related to state populations. The time variation of the expansion coefficients is calculated for ARP conditions. The transition probabilities of the two ω0 transitions are not required to be equal. The final values of the three relevant expansion coefficients indicate negative temperatures on all three transitions.},

	Abstract = {The problem of achieving population inversion adiabatically in an N-level system using one or more laser fields whose detunings and/or amplitudes are continuously varied is studied analytically and numerically. The SU(N) coherence vector picture is shown to suggest unexpected inversion procedures and also to give a generalized interpretation of adiabatic following. It is shown that the (N2-1)-dimensional SU(N) space contains an (N-1)--dimensional steady-state subspace Γ(t) whose orthonormal basis vectors Γ{\rightarrow}1,{\ldots}, Γ{\rightarrow}N-1 are given explicitly in terms of the Hamiltonian matrix elements. The motion of the system can be interpreted as a "generalized precession" of S{\rightarrow} about Γ. Multilevel adiabatic following occurs when the angle χ(t) between the coherence vector S{\rightarrow} and its projection onto Γ is very small. The multiple dimension of Γ is shown to provide a variety of paths for adiabatic inversion. The adiabatic solution is obtained by solving N-1 simple equations for the directional cosines of S{\rightarrow} on Γ{\rightarrow}i. The adiabatic solution and time scale and the state taken up by the atomic variable are discussed analytically and numerically for a three-level system.},

The one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii model for atom lasers is used, and the simulation fits the experiments. By analyzing the model, the noise is induced due to the existence of the middle state between the initial state and the output state. The fluctuations do not decrease by decreasing the coupling strength, which is different from continuously outcoupled atom laser. It also shows that the interference of outcoupled matter wave is a new noise mechanics leading to severe fluctuations.},

The model that I employ assumes that the time that a passenger requires to load his or her luggage is the dominant contribution to the time needed to completely fill the aircraft. The optimal boarding strategy may reduce the time required to board and airplane by over a factor of four and possibly more depending upon the dimensions of the aircraft. I explore some features of the optimal boarding method and discuss practical modifications to the optimal. Finally, I mention some of the benefits that could come from implementing and improved passenger boarding scheme.},

We examine two models of the fluctuating source, monopole fluctuations and dipole fluctuations, and show that these correspond to two well-known CSL models. We relate the two GRW parameters of CSL to fundamental constants, and we explain the energy increase of particles due to collapse as arising from the loss of vacuum gravitational energy.},

	Abstract = {The stability of a quantum superposition of two different stationary mass distributions is examined, where the perturbing effect of each distribution on the space-time structure is taken into account, in accordance with the principles of general relativity. It is argued that the definition of the time-translation operator for the superposed space-times involves an inherent ill-definedness, leading to an essential uncertainty in the energy of the superposed state which, in the Newtonian limit, is proportional to the gravitational self-energyEΔ of the difference between the two mass distributions. This is consistent with a suggested finite lifetime of the order of ħ/EΔ for the superposed state, in agreement with a certain proposal made by the author for a gravitationally induced spontaneous quantum state reduction, and with closely related earlier suggestions by Di{\'o}si and by Ghirardiet al.},

Theoretical predictions of the rate coefficients for elastic processes and losses due to the Penning and associative ionization processes are reported for temperatures ranging from 1 μK to 1 K. The sensitivity of the rate constants to uncertainties in the molecular potentials and autoionization widths has been investigated. The total ionization loss rates were found to be sensitive to the short-range form of the 1Σg+ molecular potential and the autoionization widths, while the total elastic rate constants exhibit greater sensitivity to the short-range 5Σg+ molecular potential.},

	Abstract = {We show how to adapt the ideas of local energy and momentum conservation in order to derive modifications to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which can be used phenomenologically to describe irreversible effects in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach involves the derivation of a simplified quantum kinetic theory, in which all processes are treated locally. It is shown that this kinetic theory can then be transformed into a number of phase-space representations, of which the Wigner function description, although approximate, is shown to be the most advantageous. In this description, the quantum kinetic master equation takes the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with noise and damping added according to a well defined prescription - an equation we call the <I>stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation</I>. From this, a very simplified description we call the <I>phenomenological growth equation</I>can be derived. We use this equation to study&#160;(i) the nucleation and growth of vortex lattices, and&#160;(ii) nonlinear losses in a hydrogen condensate, which it is shown can lead to a curious instability phenomenon.},

	Abstract = {The interaction of short and strong laser pulses with an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate is found to generate patterns of recoiling atoms that are different from those seen in previous light-scattering experiments. This phenomenon can only be explained by optical stimulation, showing that the previous description of superradiance as atomic stimulation is incomplete and that matter-wave amplification in Bose-Einstein condensates is suppressed at short times. Our experiments clarify the nature of bosonic stimulation in the four-wave mixing of light and atoms.

@misc{Mueller:2007qy,
	Abstract = {Measuring very small forces, particularly those of a gravitational nature, has always been of great interest, as fundamental tests of our understanding of the physical laws. Ultra-long period mechanical oscillators, typically used in such measurements, will have kT/2 of thermal energy associated with each degree of freedom, owing to the equal-partition of energy. Moreover, additional seismic fluctuations in the low frequency band can raise this equivalent temperature significantly to 10^5 K. Recently, various methods using opto-mechanical forces have been reported to decrease this thermal energy for MHz, micro-cantilever oscillators, effectively cooling them. Here we show the direct, dynamical cooling of a gram-size, macroscopic oscillator to 300 mK in equivalent temperature - noise reduction by a factor of 10^6. By precisely measuring the torsional oscillator's position, we dynamically provide an external 'viscous' damping force. Such an added, dissipative force is essentially free of noise, resulting in rapid cooling of the oscillator. Additionally, we observe the time-dependent cooling process, at various cooling force parameters. This parameter dependence agrees well with a simple physical model which we provide. We further show that the device is sensitive to forces as small as <100 fN - a force only a few percent of that typically exerted by a single biological molecule or that observed in a typical gravity experiment. We also demonstrate the dynamic control of the oscillator's natural frequency, over a span of nearly two decades. The method may find important applications in precision measurements of very weak forces.},

	Abstract = {Since the kinetic and the potential energy term of the real time nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation can each be solved exactly, the entire equation can be solved to any order via splitting algorithms. We verified the fourth-order convergence of some well known algorithms by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation numerically. All such splitting algorithms suffer from a latent numerical instability even when the total energy is very well conserved. A detail error analysis reveals that the noise, or elementary excitations of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger, obeys the Bogoliubov spectrum and the instability is due to the exponential growth of high wave number noises caused by the splitting process. For a continuum wave function, this instability is unavoidable no matter how small the time step. For a discrete wave function, the instability can be avoided only for $\dt k_{max}^2{<\atop\sim}2 \pi$, where $k_{max}=\pi/\Delta x$.},

@article{Levy:2007vn,
	Abstract = {The alternating- and direct-current (a.c. and d.c.) Josephson effects were first discovered in a system of two superconductors, the macroscopic wavefunctions of which are weakly coupled via a tunnelling barrier1, 2. In the a.c. Josephson effect1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, a constant chemical potential difference (voltage) is applied, which causes an oscillating current to flow through the barrier. Because the frequency is proportional to the chemical potential difference only, the a.c. Josephson effect serves as a voltage standard2. In the d.c. Josephson effect, a small constant current is applied, resulting in a constant supercurrent flowing through the barrier4, 5, 8. In a sense, the particles do not 'feel' the presence of the tall tunnelling barrier, and flow freely through it with no driving potential. Bose--Einstein condensates should also support Josephson effects9; however, while plasma oscillations have been seen10 in a single Bose--Einstein condensate Josephson junction, the a.c. Josephson effect remains elusive. Here we observe the a.c. and d.c. Josephson effects in a single Bose--Einstein condensate Josephson junction. The d.c. Josephson effect has been observed previously only in superconducting systems11; in our study, it is evident when we measure the chemical potential--current relation of the Bose--Einstein condensate Josephson junction4, 11. Our system constitutes a trapped-atom interferometer12, 13 with continuous readout14, which operates on the basis of the a.c. Josephson effect. In addition, the measured chemical potential--current relation shows that the device is suitable for use as an analogue of the superconducting quantum interference device, which would sense rotation2, 15.},

The properties of dark-state polaritons such as the group velocity are determined by the mixing angle between light and matter components and can be controlled by an external coherent field as the pulse propagates. In particular, light pulses can be decelerated and ``trapped'' in which case their shape and quantum state are mapped onto metastable collective states of matter. Possible applications of this reversible coherent-control technique are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We investigate in the mean field limit the dynamics of vortices in trapped Bose-Einstein condensates, using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two and three dimensions. Vortices are found to be readily generated by a variety of mechanisms, including collisions between condensates or with an aperture, or by mechanically disturbing the condensate with a perturber. In particular, we study the rotational stirring of a condensate with a repulsive Gaussian potential, representing a far-blue-detuned laser. We find that for a condensate rotationally stirred just below a critical angular frequency, given by the energy difference between the ground and vortex eigenstates, a single vortex cycles into the centre of the condensate and then out. We analyse this behaviour in terms of a two state model, and show that it can be understood as nonlinear Rabi cycling between the ground and vortex states of the condensate. The single vortex cycling regime occurs both in two dimensions, and in three dimensions for a range of trap geometries. We show how this dynamical behaviour can be used to prepare a central vortex state in a parameter regime accessible to current experiments. We also show (in two and three dimensions) that a singly quantised central vortex is dynamically stable to a perturbation, while a doubly quantised central vortex immediately dissociates into two unit vortices upon perturbation. We give a simple geometrical explanation for this instability. We find that a central vortex remains in the condensate if a perturber is inserted and left in place: the condensate exhibits persistent flow past the obstruction, as is characteristic of a superfluid. Rotationally stirring a condensate in a spherically symmetric trap can form vortex lines which collide and exchange sections, an example of the rich dynamical behaviour of these structures.},

@phdthesis{Dutton:2002ys,
	Abstract = {We present theoretical analysis and experimental results of methods to achieve 
and use ultra-slow light (USL), stopped light, and compressed light in sodium Bose- 
Einstein condensates (BECs). We present applications of these methods to study and 
harness both the coherent and superfluid properties of BECs. 

A description of the propagation of probe and coupling laser fields in three-level Λ 
configuration atoms is presented in a semi-classical description. This formalism is used 
to derive how electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and USL arise. We 
present novel theoretical results on the effect a fourth level, and effects of nonlinearities 
associated with a strong probe. Experimental demonstration of ultra-slow light is 
presented. A description which includes atomic motion in Bose-condensed samples 
of alkali atoms is developed in a mean field description and coupled Gross-Pitaevskii 
equations are derived. A numerical code which solves these equations is presented. An 
analytic and numerical analysis reveal the limits on ultra-slow light and compressed 
light imposed by the external atomic dynamics. 

We then show that using USL and switching the coupling field off allows storage 
of the coherent probe pulse information (amplitude and phase) in the atomic fields. 
Switching the coupling beam back on writes the coherent information back onto the probe field. Experimental demonstration is presented. We present experimental data 
and theoretical analysis showing how stopping light in a BEC creates an atom laser 
with the highest reported phase space density flux to date. Alternatively, reviving the 
probe pulse after significant BEC dynamics can be used to process the information 
before it is written back onto the probe. Possible applications to quantum processing 
are discussed. 

We then present results on a light ``roadblock'', whereby blocking part of the cou- 
pling field spatially compresses probe pulses to sizes on the order of the condensate 
healing length. The compressed probe creates large amplitude, short wavelength ex- 
citations in the BEC which form solitons via quantum shock waves, and later multiple 
vortices via the snake instability. Dynamics of multiple vortices in the BEC are ex- 
plored. Further possibilities for studying superfluidity in two component condensates 
are considered.},

	Abstract = {We report on precision measurements of spin-dependent interaction-strengths in the 87Rb spin-1 and spin-2 hyperfine ground states. Our method is based on the recent observation of coherence in the collisionally driven spin-dynamics of ultracold atom pairs trapped in optical lattices. Analysis of the Rabi-type oscillations between two spin states of an atom pair allows a direct determination of the coupling parameters in the interaction Hamiltonian. We deduce differences in scattering lengths from our data that can directly be compared to theoretical predictions in order to test interatomic potentials. Our measurements agree with the predictions within 20\%. The knowledge of these coupling parameters allows one to determine the nature of the magnetic ground state. Our data imply a ferromagnetic ground state for 87Rb in the f = 1 manifold, in agreement with earlier experiments performed without the optical lattice. For 87Rb in the f = 2 manifold, the data point towards an antiferromagnetic ground state; however our error bars do not exclude a possible cyclic phase.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the spectrum of the scattered light from quantum degenerate atomic gases obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. The atoms are assumed to occupy two ground states, which are optically coupled through a common excited state by two low-intensity off-resonant light beams. In the presence of a Bose condensate in both ground states, the atoms may exhibit light-induced oscillations between the two condensates analogous to the Josephson effect. The spectrum of the scattered light is calculated in the limit of a low oscillation frequency. In the spectrum we are able to observe qualitative features depending on the phase difference between the macroscopic wave functions of the two condensates. Thus, our optical scheme could possibly be used as an experimental realization of the spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) gauge symmetry in the Bose-Einstein condensation.},

Two condensates separated by ~40 micrometers were created by evaporatively cooling sodium atoms in a double-well potential formed by magnetic and optical forces. High-contrast matter-wave interference fringes with a period of ~15 micrometers were observed after switching off the potential and letting the condensates expand for 40 milliseconds and overlap. This demonstrates that Bose condensed atoms are "laser-like"; that is, they are coherent and show long-range correlations. These results have direct implications for the atom laser and the Josephson effect for atoms.},

	Abstract = {The experimental realization of Bose--Einstein condensates of dilute gases has allowed investigations of fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics at ultra-low temperatures, such as wave-like behaviour and interference phenomena. The formation of an interference pattern depends fundamentally on the phase coherence of a system; the latter may be quantified by the spatial correlation function. Phase coherence over a long range is the essential factor underlying Bose--Einstein condensation and related macroscopic quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity and superfluidity. Here we report a direct measurement of the phase coherence properties of a weakly interacting Bose gas of rubidium atoms. Effectively, we create a double slit for magnetically trapped atoms using a radio wave field with two frequency components. The correlation function of the system is determined by evaluating the interference pattern of two matter waves originating from the spatially separated 'slit' regions of the trapped gas. Above the critical temperature for Bose--Einstein condensation, the correlation function shows a rapid gaussian decay, as expected for a thermal gas. Below the critical temperature, the correlation function has a different shape: a slow decay towards a plateau is observed, indicating the long-range phase coherence of the condensate fraction.},

The model describes the pumping and extraction of the atomic field from a trap upon its interaction with independent atomic reservoirs. The stimulated collisions between atoms in the trap, which produce a Bose condensate in the lower state of the trap, are considered. The interaction of atoms with a phonon field causes spontaneous transitions between the discrete states of the trap. Calculations performed for the three-and four-level models of the trap showed the possibility of generation of a strongly squeezed sub-Poisson Bose condensate. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the coherence properties of an atomic beam evaporatively cooled in a magnetic guide, assuming thermal equilibrium in the quantum degenerate regime. The gas experiences two-dimensional, transverse Bose-Einstein condensation rather than a full three-dimensional condensation because of the very elongated geometry of the magnetic guide. First order and second order correlation functions of the atomic field are used to characterize the coherence properties of the gas along the axis of the guide. The coherence length of the gas is found to be much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength in the strongly quantum degenerate regime. Large intensity fluctuations present in the ideal Bose gas model are found to be strongly reduced by repulsive atomic interactions; this conclusion is obtained with a one-dimensional classical field approximation valid when the temperature of the gas is much higher than its chemical potential, k_B T»|mu|.},

We consider the case of atoms with a three-level Λ scheme, in which one of the atomic transitions has a very much shorter lifetime than the other one. We found that in such a scenario the photon reabsorption in dense clouds at the frequency of the narrow transition can be considered negligible. If, in addition, inelastic processes can be kept negligible, we find that optical pumping can be used to continuously load and refill Bose-Einstein condensates, i.e., it provides a possible way to achieve a continuous atom laser.},

	Abstract = {The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases in traps is reviewed from a theoretical perspective. Mean-field theory provides a framework to understand the main features of the condensation and the role of interactions between particles. Various properties of these systems are discussed, including the density profiles and the energy of the ground-state configurations, the collective oscillations and the dynamics of the expansion, the condensate fraction and the thermodynamic functions. The thermodynamic limit exhibits a scaling behavior in the relevant length and energy scales. Despite the dilute nature of the gases, interactions profoundly modify the static as well as the dynamic properties of the system; the predictions of mean-field theory are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. Effects of superfluidity including the existence of quantized vortices and the reduction of the moment of inertia are discussed, as well as the consequences of coherence such as the Josephson effect and interference phenomena. The review also assesses the accuracy and limitations of the mean-field approach.},

	Abstract = {A new type of optical cw atom laser design is proposed that should operate at high intensity and high coherence and possibly record low temperatures. It is based on an "optical-shepherd" technique, in which far-off-resonance blue-detuned swept sheet laser beams are used to make new types of high-density traps, atom waveguides, and other components for achieving very efficient Bose-Einstein condensation and cw atom laser operation. A shepherd-enhanced trap is proposed that should be superior to conventional magneto-optic traps for the initial collection of molasses-cooled atoms. A type of dark-spot optical trap is devised that can cool large numbers of atoms to polarization-gradient temperatures at densities limited only by three-body collisional loss. A scheme is designed to use shepherd beams to capture and recycle essentially all of the escaped atoms in evaporative cooling, thereby increasing the condensate output by several orders of magnitude. Condensate atoms are stored in a shepherd trap, protected from absorbing light, under effectively zero-gravity conditions, and coupled out directly into an optical waveguide. Many experiments and devices may be possible with this cw atom laser.

Atoms confined to a permanent-magnet trap are laser cooled to 200 μK and are then evaporatively cooled to lower temperatures. Phase-space densities consistent with quantum degeneracy are measured for temperatures in the range of 100 to 400 nK. At these high phase-space densities, diffraction of a probe laser beam is observed. Modeling shows that this diffraction is a sensitive indicator of the presence of a spatially localized condensate. Although measurements of the number of condensate atoms have not been performed, the measured phase-space densities are consistent with a majority of the atoms being in the condensate, for total trap numbers as high as 2{\times}105 atoms. For 7Li, the spin-triplet s-wave scattering length is known to be negative, corresponding to an attractive interatomic interaction. Previously, Bose-Einstein condensation was predicted not to occur in such a system.},

The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.

The damping of the Kohn's mode due to the non-linear mixing turns out to be reminiscent of the effect of a finite coherence source for its optical counterpart.},

We report solutions for different range of values for the repulsive and the attractive non-linear interactions in the condensate. Also, we study a bright soliton-like variational solution for the order parameter for positive and negative values of $\Lambda $. Introducing an accumulated error function we have performed a quantitative analysis with other well-established methods as: the perturbation theory, the Thomas-Fermi approximation, and the numerical solution. This study gives a very useful result establishing the universal range of the $\Lambda $-values where each solution can be easily implemented. In particular we showed that for $\Lambda <-9$, the bright soliton function reproduces the exact solution of GPE wave function.},

A beam of atoms (bosons) in an excited state is passed through an atomic trap that traps the atoms when they are in their internal ground state. When the trap contains a Bose-Einstein condensate, the cross section for absorption of the atomic beam is increased. We examine a particular model in which this atom stimulation is observable and is also characterized by the emission of photons in a narrow cone in the direction of the atomic beam.},

The theoretical description combines quantum threshold behavior, Wigner's spin-conservation rule, and quantum-statistical symmetry requirements in a single-channel model, complementing a more complete close-coupling theory that has been reported for collisions of metastable 4He atoms. The model is supported with measurements (in the absence of light fields) of ionization rates in magneto-optically trapped samples that contain about 3{\times}108 atoms of a single isotope. The ionization rates are determined from measurements of trap loss due to light-assisted collisions combined with comparative measurements of the ion production rate in the absence and presence of trapping light. Theory and experiment show good agreement.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of Bloch oscillations of Bose-Einstein condensates in disordered lattice potentials. Due to the disorder and the interparticle interactions these oscillations undergo a dephasing, reflected in a damping of the center of mass oscillations, which should be observable under realistic experimental conditions. The interplay between interactions and disorder is far from trivial, ranging from an interaction-enhanced damping due to modulational instability for strong interactions, to an interaction-reduced damping due to a dynamical screening of the disorder potential.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that a three-level atom in the Λ configuration with arbitrary detunings can be exactly reduced to a two-level system with an effective Raman coupling, which depends nonlinearly on the intensity of the two radiation fields. This is done by exactly evaluating the unitary transformation introduced by Alexanian and Bose [Phys. Rev. A 52, 2218 (1995)] for a three-level atom coupled to two modes of the radiation field. We obtain an exact transformed Hamiltonian in which one of the three levels is decoupled for all values of the detunings. In particular, our result is then valid for any ratios of the coupling constants to detunings, even for zero detuning, in contrast to earlier work which requires that these ratios be small. We find the the eigenvalues of the exact transformed Hamiltonian and study its population dynamics},

We investigate the dynamics of an atom laser using a comprehensive one-dimensional, mean-field numerical model. We fully model the output beam and experimentally important physics such as three-body recombination. We find that at high-pump rates, the latter plays a role in suppressing the high-frequency dynamics, which would otherwise limit the stability of the output beam.},

A 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate was loaded into a one-dimensional optical lattice with quasimomentum k0 and spontaneously scattered into two final states with quasimomenta k1 and k2. Furthermore, when a seed of atoms was first created with quasimomentum k1 we observed parametric amplification of scattered atoms pairs in states k1 and k2 when the phase-matching condition was fulfilled. This process is analogous to optical parametric generation and amplification of photons and could be used to efficiently create entangled pairs of atoms. Furthermore, these results explain the dynamic instability of condensates in moving lattices observed in recent experiments.},

The proposed FHTn method is an efficient approach for numerical evaluation of an arbitrary integer order of the Hankel transform (HT). As an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply the FHTn technique to the analysis of cylindrical EM field propagation through a diffractive microlens.},

Predictions for the total outcoupling rate as a function of the radio frequency and for the beam wave function are given. We establish a sum rule for the energy-integrated outcoupling, which leads to a separate determination of the coupling strength between the atoms and radiation field. For a noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate analytic solutions are derived which are subsequently extended to include the effects of atomic interactions. The interactions enhance interference effects in the beam profile and modify the outcoupling rate of the atom laser. We provide a complete quantum-mechanical solution which is in line with experimental findings and allows us to determine the validity of commonly used approximative methods. We also extend the formalism to a fermionic atom laser and analyze the effect of superfluidity on the outcoupling of atoms.},

	Abstract = {We formulate a wave-atom-optics theory of the collective atomic recoil laser (CARL) where the atomic center-of-mass motion is treated quantum mechanically. By comparing the predictions of this theory with those of the ray-atom-optics theory, which treats the center-of-mass atomic motion classically, we show that for the case of a far off-resonant pump laser the ray-optics model fails to predict the linear response of the CARL when the temperature is of the order of the recoil temperature or less. This is due to the fact that in this temperature regime one can no longer ignore the effects of matter-wave diffraction on the atomic center-of-mass motion.},

@article{Stenger:1998uq,
	Abstract = {Bose--Einstein condensates --- a low-temperature form of matter in which a macroscopic population of bosons occupies the quantum-mechanical ground state --- have been demonstrated for weakly interacting, dilute gases of alkali-metal1, 2, 3 and hydrogen25 atoms. Magnetic traps are usually employed to confine the condensates, but have the drawback that spin flips in the atoms lead to untrapped states. For this reason, the spin orientation of the trapped alkali atoms cannot be regarded as a degree of freedom. Such condensates are therefore described by a scalar order parameter, like the spinless superfluid 4He. In contrast, a recently realized optical trap4 for sodium condensates confines atoms independently of their spin orientations. This offers the possibility of studying 'spinor' condensates in which spin comprises a degree of freedom, so that the order parameter is a vector rather than scalar quantity. Here we report the observation of equilibrium states of sodium spinor condensates in an optical trap. The freedom of spin orientation leads to the formation of spin domains in an external magnetic field, which can be either miscible or immiscible with one another.},

@article{Deng:1999qy,
	Abstract = {The advent of the laser as an intense source of coherent light gave rise to nonlinear optics, which now plays an important role in many areas of science and technology. One of the first applications of nonlinear optics was the multi-wave mixing1,2 of several optical fields in a nonlinear medium (one in which the refractive index depends on the intensity of the field) to produce coherent light of a new frequency. The recent experimental realization of the matter-wave 'laser'3,4---based on the extraction of coherent atoms from a Bose--Einstein condensate5---opens the way for analogous experiments with intense sources of matter waves: nonlinear atom optics6. Here we report coherent four-wave mixing in which three sodium matter waves of differing momenta mix to produce, by means of nonlinear atom--atom interactions, a fourth wave with new momentum. We find a clear signature of a four-wave mixing process in the dependence of the generated matter wave on the densities of the input waves. Our results may ultimately facilitate the production and investigation of quantum correlations between matter waves.},

	Abstract = {We have measured the three-body decay of a Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium (87Rb) atoms prepared in the doubly polarized ground state F=mF=2. Our data are taken for a peak atomic density in the condensate varying between 221014 cm-3 at initial time and 721013 cm-3, 16 s later. Taking into account the influence of the uncondensed atoms on the decay of the condensate, we deduce a rate constant for condensed atoms L=1.8 (-0.5) 210-29 cm6 s-1. For these densities we did not find a significant contribution of two-body processes such as spin dipole relaxation.},

At 250 gauss (G), the two- and three-body loss rates were measured to be K2  =  (1.87$\pm$0.95$\pm$0.19){\times}10-14 cm3/s and K3  =  (4.24-0.29+0.70$\pm$0.85){\times}10-25 cm6/s, respectively. As the magnetic field is decreased from 250 G towards a Feshbach resonance at 155 G, the inelastic rates decrease to a minimum and then increase dramatically, peaking at the Feshbach resonance. Both two- and three-body losses are important, and individual contributions have been compared with theory.},

We infer that density fluctuations are suppressed in the BEC samples. We measured the three-body recombination rate constants for condensates and cold noncondensates from number loss in the F  =  1,mf  =  -1 hyperfine state of 87Rb. The ratio of these is 7.4(2.6) which agrees with the theoretical factor of 3! and demonstrates that condensate atoms are less bunched than noncondensate atoms.},

The atoms are assumed to occupy two ground states, which are optically coupled through a common excited state by two low-intensity off-resonant light beams. In the presence of a Bose condensate in both ground states, the atoms may exhibit light-induced oscillations between the two condensates analogous to the Josephson effect. The spectrum of the scattered light is calculated in the limit of a low oscillation frequency. In the spectrum we are able to observe qualitative features depending on the phase difference between the macroscopic wave functions of the two condensates. Thus, our optical scheme could possibly be used as an experimental realization of the spontaneous breakdown of the U(1) gauge symmetry in the Bose-Einstein condensation.},

	Abstract = {We propose a light-scattering scheme to measure the relative phase of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and its diffusion rate. The proposal relies on the existence of two independent condensates coupled to a common excited state. To this end, we consider a two-well ground-state potential together with excited-state trap wave functions that extend over the whole region. When the first trap is driven by a weak monochromatic laser field, the light scattered from the second trap has a nonzero mean-electric field amplitude with a phase shift proportional to the difference of the condensate phases. When both condensates are driven, the phases of the two laser fields can be adjusted to cancel the scattering completely by a quantum interference. The particular value of the laser phase difference that gives zero scattering determines the relative phase of the two condensates.},

	Abstract = {We present phase-space techniques for the modelling of spontaneous emission in two-level bosonic atoms. The positive-P representation is shown to give a full and complete description and can be further developed to give exact treatments of the interaction of degenerate bosons with the electromagnetic field in a given experimental situation. The Wigner representation, even when truncated at second order, is shown to need a doubling of the phase-space to allow for a positive-definite diffusion matrix in the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation and still fails to agree with the full quantum results of the positive-P representation. We show that quantum statistics and correlations between the ground and excited states affect the dynamics of the emission process, so that it is in general non-exponential.},

Discretization of the problem results in a Bose-Hubbard--type Hamiltonian, whose imaginary time evolution is made computationally accessible by stochastic factorization of the kinetic energy. To achieve convergence for low enough temperatures such that quantum fluctuations are essential, the stochastic factorization is generalized to blocks, and ideas from density-matrix renormalization are employed.

	Abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed. },

	Abstract = {The positive P representation is a very successful tool in quantum optics. However, the usual assumption of negligible boundary terms in the time-evolution equations is not always valid. We explore the range of validity of the time-evolution equations both analytically and by numerical investigation of a number of specific examples. We present practical ways of verifying the validity of the use of the positive P representation and find that the standard time-evolution equation can become invalid when nonlinear terms (at unit photon number) are large relative to the damping rate. This is very much larger than is normally the case in nonlinear optics, except possibly near resonances. We are able to show that when the positive P representation is invalid, the boundary terms, normally neglected in an integration by parts, become non-negligible. When numerical simulations are carried out using the positive P representation, specific checks given in this paper should be carried out to verify the compactness of the distribution. In conclusion, we find that (apart from special cases) this technique of quantum time evolution is typically asymptotically valid in the limit of small nonlinearity, rather than exact.},

	Abstract = {We perform and compare different analyses of triply degenerate four-wave mixing in the regime where three fields of the same frequency interact via a nonlinear medium with a field at three times the frequency. As the generalized Fokker-Planck equation (GFPE) for the positive-P function of this system contains third-order derivatives, there is no mapping onto genuine stochastic differential equations. Using techniques of quantum field theory, we are able to write stochastic difference equations that we may integrate numerically. We compare the results of this method with those obtained by the use of approximations based on semiclassical equations, and on truncation of the GFPE leading to stochastic differential equations. In the region where the difference equations converge, the stochastic methods agree for the field intensities, but give different predictions for the quantum statistics.},

We find that, after a certain interaction length, both the macroscopic and quantum-statistical properties of the harmonic and fundamental fields are qualitatively different from those found in previous analyses. The mean fields do not vary in a monotonic way, but oscillate with the propagation length, leading to an unexpected periodic revival of the fundamental field, triggered by the quantum fluctuations always present in the mode. Accordingly, the amplitude noise of the fundamental, previously predicted to be perfectly squeezed for long interaction lengths, actually reaches a very small minimum for a definite length, then increases again.},

	Abstract = {The standard quantum limit to the linewidth of a laser for which the gain medium can be adiabatically eliminated is l0=κ/2n̄. Here κ is the intensity damping rate and n̄ the mean photon number. This contains equal contributions from the loss and gain processes, so that simple arguments which attribute the linewidth wholly to phase noise from spontaneous gain are wrong. I show that an unstimulated gain process actually introduces no phase noise, so that the ultimate quantum limit to the linewidth comes from the loss alone and is equal to lult=κ/4n̄. I investigate a number of physical gain mechanisms which attempt to achieve gain without phase noise: a linear atom-field coupling with a finite interaction time, a nonlinear atom-field coupling, and adiabatic photon transfer using a counterintuitive pulse sequence. The first at best reaches the standard limit l0, the second reaches 3 / 4l0, and the third reaches the ultimate limit of lult=1 / 2l0.},

	Abstract = {A theory of electromagnetic field measurement by means of photoionization is developed and applied to photoelectron counting. A probability theory involving multitime joint probability functions for a sequence of photoionizations is formulated. A general quantum-theory definition is proposed for the nonexclusive probability function which occurs in the probability theory. Approximations are then introduced to derive expressions for this probability function which involve correlation functions of the photoionization detector and the electromagnetic field-plus-source. The general theory is used to derive quantities of interest in photo-ionization counting experiments. Expressions are derived for (1) the probability Pn(t, t+T) that n photo-ionizations are observed in the time interval t to t+T, and (2) quantities related to Pn(t, t+T), such as its generating function and various moments. Pn(t, t+T) is found to be a compound Poisson distribution determined by the density operator of the field when the latter is expressed in Glauber's P representation. Using this result, the character of Pn(t, t+T) is examined for several specific density operators. These correspond to a coherent state, various fields with the mode phases distributed independently of the mode amplitudes, and a "spread-out" coherent state.},

	Abstract = {The concept of coherence which has conventionally been used in optics is found to be inadequate to the needs of recently opened areas of experiment. To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex field strengths is defined. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an infinite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satisfied. It is noted that the fields historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of fields coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity. Coherent fields can be generated with arbitrary spectra.},

	Abstract = {We analyze methods designed to go beyond the standard quantum limit for a class of atomic interferometers, where the quantity of interest is the difference of phase shifts obtained by two independent atomic ensembles. An example is given by an atomic Sagnac interferometer, where for two ensembles propagating in opposite directions in the interferometer this phase difference encodes the angular velocity of the experimental setup. We discuss methods of separately or jointly squeezing observables of the two atomic ensembles, and compare in detail the advantages and drawbacks of such schemes. In particular, we show that the method of joint squeezing may improve the variance by up to a factor of 2. We take into account fluctuations of the number of atoms in both the preparation and the measurement stage, and obtain bounds on the difference between the numbers of atoms in the two ensembles, as well as on the detection efficiency, which have to be fulfilled in order to surpass the standard quantum limit. Under realistic conditions, the performance of both schemes can be improved significantly by reading out the phase difference via a quantum nondemolition measurement. Finally, we discuss a scheme using macroscopically entangled ensembles.},

	Abstract = {The article presents the HYPER project, a proposal for a satellite mission on precision matter-wave interferometry. For the mission several scientific objectives are under investigation, for which atom interferometers proved on ground to be a true complementary and competitive alternative for classical concepts: The application of atom interferometers as gyroscopes, the measurement of the gravitational acceleration (including tests of the universality of the free fall of atoms) and the precise determination of the fine-structure constant. The paper focuses on the use of cold-atom gyroscopes to map the Lense-Thirring effect close by the Earth and reports on results of recent feasibility studies of the European Space Agency. HYPER requires new concepts of compact, high-resolution matter-wave gyroscopes, which are better adapted to the use in satellite based experiments. The article will give a concise overview of the status and strategies in the field.},

	Abstract = {In this article we focus on the propagation of a beam of particles guided by a transversely confining potential. We consider different regimes. In the classical regime, we describe the beam by means of a set of hydrodynamic-like equations. We apply this formalism in order to investigate two practical ways for increasing the collision rate: by using a constriction or by tilting the guide. A high enough collision rate is indeed the most crucial prerequisite for reaching the quantum degenerate regime by means of evaporative cooling. In the quantum regime, we study the propagation of bosonic atoms through a constriction in two opposite regimes: the collision-less one and the Thomas--Fermi one.},

	Abstract = {We present a theoretical analysis of the evaporative cooling of a magnetically guided atomic beam by means of discrete radio-frequency antennas. First we derive the changes in flux and temperature, as well as in collision rate and phase-space density, for a single evaporation step. Next we show how the occurrence of collisions during the propagation between two successive antennas can be probed. Finally, we discuss the optimization of the evaporation ramp with several antennas to reach quantum degeneracy. We estimate the number of antennas required to increase the phase-space density by several orders of magnitude. We find that at least 30 antennas are needed to gain a factor 108 in phase-space density.},

The balance between the arrival of new particles and the evaporation of particles from the trapped cloud leads to a steady state that we characterize in terms of particle number and temperature. This scheme is particularly interesting for a cigar-shaped potential where different longitudinal and transverse evaporation thresholds can be chosen. We show that a resonance occurs when the transverse evaporation threshold coincides with the energy of the incident particles. It leads to a dramatic increase in phase space density with respect to the incident beam.},

This type of interferometer promises to be useful for precise measurement of the photon recoil energy and also for large area atomic interferometers since it allows transfer of a large number of photon recoil momenta to the atoms with high efficiency. In preliminary experiments, we have obtained a coherent transfer efficiency of 95% with transfer of photon momenta and 98.4% with no transfer of momenta. Over 140 photon momenta have been transferred coherently to the atoms.},

The simple form of the ansatz is modified for both cylindrically symmetric and completely anisotropic harmonic traps.

	Abstract = {This manuscript presents various experimental and theoretical aspects concerning a specific
system of atom optics : the atom laser. In our experiment, this one results from a
Bose-Einstein condensate of rubidium 87 and we thus initially detail the various cooling
techniques used to obtain this coherent atomic source in a hybrid ferromagnetic trap.
The atom lasers we produce are extracted from the condensed cloud by radiofrequency,
and propagate vertically under the effect of gravity. One specificity of our setup lies in the
strong magnetic confinement used, which results in non negligible collisional interactions between
the laser and the condensed source. We show that this has an influence, not only on the
atom laser coupling dynamics, but also on its propagation. We indeed observe a transverse
structure containing caustics on the laser beam. By using methods initially developed for
photonic optics (eikonal approximation, Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral, ABCD matrices), we calculate
the atom laser wavefunction. Moreover, we characterize the matter wave propagation
in the paraxial regime by using the beam quality factor M2.
We finally report the realization of an atom laser, guided by a horizontal optical potential,
which enables us to cancel the acceleration due to gravity in such way, that the De Broglie
wavelength remains constant throughout propagation.},

	Abstract = {We point out a few questionable features of Bogoliubov's theory of an interacting Bose gas. In this theory, one does not diagonalize the part $\hat{H}_2$ of the Hamiltonian that is quadratic in the boson creation and annihilation operators, but instead one diagonalizes the ``grand canonical Hamiltonian" $\tilde{H}_2 = \hat{H}_2 - \mu \hat{N}_1$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and the operator $\hat{N}_1$ counts the number of bosons outside the condensate. We show that such a procedure leads to an energy cost of exciting a single boson from the condensate to the single-particle state of momentum ${\bf k}$ which diverges like $1/k$ in the long wavelength limit. We also show that the above divergence does not occur if one diagonalizes $\hat{H}_2$ directly, which results in a gapped excitation spectrum, both for bosons and for quasiparticles. Gapped excitation spectra for bosons were derived previously, by a number of authors, and were deemed unphysical on the grounds that such spectra violate Goldstone's theorem. Here, we argue that such an interpretation stems from an improper identification of the collective Goldstone modes of the system, which have to do with fluctuations of the phase of the condensate wavefunction. More importantly, we explicitly show that the so-called "quasiparticle" modes of $\tilde{H}_2$ represent single-particle excitations, {\em not} collective sound waves. Finally, we show that the average interaction energy between condensed and depleted bosons is negative, even for strictly repulsive interactions, which we argue seriously undermines the validity of the present formulation of Bogoliubov's theory.},

	Abstract = {The classical region of a Bose gas consists of all single-particle modes that have a high average occupation and are well-described by a classical field. Highly-occupied modes only occur in massive Bose gases at ultra-cold temperatures, in contrast to the photon case where there are highly-occupied modes at all temperatures. For the Bose gas the number of these modes is dependent on the temperature, the total number of particles and their interaction strength. In this paper we characterize the classical region of a harmonically trapped Bose gas over a wide parameter regime. We use a Hartree-Fock approach to account for the effects of interactions, which we observe to significantly change the classical region as compared to the idealized case. We compare our results to full classical field calculations and show that the Hartree-Fock approach provides a qualitatively accurate description of classical region for the interacting gas.},

The model, which is a direct extension of that of the collective atomic recoil laser, describes the emission of two superradiant pulses along the sample's major axis simultaneous with the formation of a bidimensional atomic grating inside the sample. It provides a simple physical picture of the recent observation of collective light scattering from a Bose--Einstein condensate [Science 285 (1999) 571]. In addition, the model provides an analytical description of the temporal evolution of the scattered light intensity which shows good quantitative agreement with the experimental results of Inouye et al.},

We present a detailed theory of this phenomenon in which condensate depletion leads to mode competition, which, together with the directional dependence of the scattering rate, is ultimately responsible for the observed phenomena. The nonlinear response of the system is shown to be highly sensitive to initial quantum fluctuations which cause large run to run variations in the observed superradiant pulses.},

	Abstract = {We present a new technique for the numerical simulation of axisymmetric systems. This technique avoids the coordinate singularities which often arise when cylindrical or polar-spherical coordinate finite difference grids are used, particularly in simulating tensor partial differential equations like those of 3+1 numerical relativity. For a system axisymmetric about the z axis, the basic idea is to use a three-dimensional Cartesian (x,y,z) coordinate grid which covers (say) the y=0 plane, but is only one finite-difference-molecule--width thick in the y direction. The field variables in the central y=0 grid plane can be updated using normal (x,y,z)-coordinate finite differencing, while those in the y≠ 0 grid planes can be computed from those in the central plane by using the axisymmetry assumption and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a set of fully nonlinear test computations in 3+1 numerical general relativity, involving both black holes and collapsing gravitational waves.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of Bose-Einstein condensates is amply described by the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field theory which assumes all bosons to reside in a single time-dependent one-particle state throughout the propagation process. In this work, we go beyond mean-field and develop an essentially-exact many-body theory for the propagation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of $N$ interacting identical bosons. In our theory, the time-dependent many-boson wavefunction is written as a sum of permanents assembled from orthogonal one-particle functions, or orbitals, where {\it both} the expansion coefficients {\it and} the permanents (orbitals) themselves are {\it time-dependent} and fully determined according to a standard time-dependent variational principle. By employing either the usual Lagrangian formulation or the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle we arrive at two sets of coupled equations-of-motion, one for the orbitals and one for the expansion coefficients. The first set comprises of first-order differential equations in time and non-linear integro-differential equations in position space, whereas the second set consists of first-order differential equations with time-dependent coefficients. We call our theory multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons, or MCTDHB($M$), where $M$ specifies the number of time-dependent orbitals used to construct the permanents. Numerical implementation of the theory is reported and illustrative numerical examples of many-body dynamics of trapped Bose-Einstein condensates are provided and discussed.},

The atomic dynamics inside the guide is analyzed by solving the Boltzmann equation with two different approaches: an approximate analytical ansatz and a Monte-Carlo simulation. Within their domain of validity, these two methods are found to be in very good agreement with each other. They allow us to determine how the phase-space density and the flux of the beam vary along its direction of propagation. We find a significant increase for the phase-space density along the guide for realistic experimental parameters. By extrapolation, we estimate the length of the beam needed to reach quantum degeneracy.},

By collective atomic recoil lasing (CARL) a coherent superposition of two atomic wave packets with different momenta is created. Varying the intensity of a weak counterpropagating laser beam we observe the transition from the pure superradiant regime to the Bragg scattering regime, where Rabi oscillations in a two-level system are observed. The process is limited by the decoherence between the two atomic wave packets. In the superradiant regime the experiment gives evidence of a contribution to decoherence which depends on the initial velocity of the condensate.

The first two are effects that can be described with a semiclassical model, and have been studied in detail for both pumped and unpumped atom lasers. The third is a purely quantum statistical effect, and has been studied only in zero dimensional models. We examine an unpumped atom laser in one dimension using a quantum field theory using stochastic methods based on the truncated Wigner approach. This allows spatial and statistical effects to be examined simultaneously, and the linewidth limit for unpumped atom lasers is quantified in various limits.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the linewidth of a quasi-continuous atom laser within a semiclassical framework. In the high flux regime, the lasing mode can exhibit a number of undesirable features such as density fluctuations. We show that the output therefore has a complicated structure that can be somewhat simplified using Raman outcoupling methods and energy-momentum selection rules. In the weak outcoupling limit, we find that the linewidth of an atom laser is instantaneously Fourier limited, but, due to the energy `chirp' associated with the draining of a condensate, the long-term linewidth of an atom laser is equivalent to the chemical potential of the condensate source. We show that correctly sweeping the outcoupling frequency can recover the Fourier-limited linewidth.},

The stirring may lead to the nucleation of one or more vortices, whose presence is revealed unambiguously by the precession of the axes of the quadrupolar mode. For a stirring frequency Ω below the single vortex nucleation threshold Ωc, no measurable precession occurs. Just above Ωc, the angular momentum deduced from the precession is ∼ħ. For stirring frequencies above Ωc the angular momentum is a smooth and increasing function of Ω, until an angular frequency is reached at which the vortex lattice disappears.},

@article{Ginsberg:2007fk,
	Abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in manipulating matter with light, and light with matter1. Resonant laser fields interacting with cold, dense atom clouds provide a particularly rich system2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Such light fields interact strongly with the internal electrons of the atoms, and couple directly to external atomic motion through recoil momenta imparted when photons are absorbed and emitted. Ultraslow light propagation in Bose--Einstein condensates7 represents an extreme example of resonant light manipulation using cold atoms. Here we demonstrate that a slow light pulse can be stopped and stored in one Bose--Einstein condensate and subsequently revived from a totally different condensate, 160 m away; information is transferred through conversion of the optical pulse into a travelling matter wave. In the presence of an optical coupling field, a probe laser pulse is first injected into one of the condensates where it is spatially compressed to a length much shorter than the coherent extent of the condensate. The coupling field is then turned off, leaving the atoms in the first condensate in quantum superposition states that comprise a stationary component and a recoiling component in a different internal state. The amplitude and phase of the spatially localized light pulse are imprinted on the recoiling part of the wavefunction, which moves towards the second condensate. When this 'messenger' atom pulse is embedded in the second condensate, the system is re-illuminated with the coupling laser. The probe light is driven back on and the messenger pulse is coherently added to the matter field of the second condensate by way of slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification. The revived light pulse records the relative amplitude and phase between the recoiling atomic imprint and the revival condensate. Our results provide a dramatic demonstration of coherent optical information processing with matter wave dynamics. Such quantum control may find application in quantum information processing and wavefunction sculpting.},

	Abstract = {We present an introduction to phase-space techniques (PST) based on a quantum-field-theoretical (QFT) approach. In addition to bridging the gap between PST and QFT, our approach results in a number of generalizations of the PST. First, for problems where the usual PST do not result in a genuine Fokker-Planck equation (even after phase-space doubling) and hence fail to produce a stochastic differential equation (SDE), we show how the system in question may be approximated via stochastic difference equations (SE). Second, we show that introducing sources into the SDE's (or SE's) generalizes them to a full quantum nonlinear stochastic response problem (thus generalizing Kubo's linear reaction theory to a quantum nonlinear stochastic response theory). Third, we establish general relations linking quantum response properties of the system in question to averages of operator products ordered in a way different from time normal. This extends PST to a much wider assemblage of operator products than are usually considered in phase-space approaches. In all cases, our approach yields a very simple and straightforward way of deriving stochastic equations in phase space.},

	Abstract = {The transverse mode of an atom laser beam that is outcoupled from a Bose--Einstein condensate is investigated and is found to be strongly determined by the mean-field interaction of the laser beam with the condensate. For repulsive interactions, the condensate acts as a diverging lens for the outcoupled atoms, and transverse interference fringes in the atomic beam are predicted due to the coherent addition of amplitudes for atoms emitted from different regions in the condensate. This effect can be used to investigate the transverse coherence of an atom laser beam.},

We find that the continuous atom laser has large density fluctuations when the Rabi frequency becomes greater than the radial trapping frequency, due to the output coupling populating all accessible Zeeman states. In addition, we find that a state-changing output coupler for a continuous atom laser switches off as the output-coupling strength, parametrized in general by the Rabi frequency, is increased above a critical value. The numerical solution of a one-dimensional five-state Gross-Pitaevskii model for the atom laser is in good qualitative agreement with the experiment.},

Motivated by recent experiments on the reflection of condensates from silicon surfaces, we revisit the so-called {\em classical field} description of condensate dynamics, which incorporates the effects of quantum noise and can also be generalized to include thermal effects. The noise is included in a stochastic manner through the initial conditions. We show that the inclusion of such noise is important in the quantitative description of the recent reflection experiments.},

	Abstract = {The development of high sensitivity and high accuracy atom interferometers requires new theoretical tools for their modelization: in this article we emphasize specifically a generalized Fresnel-Kirchhoff formula for atom optics in the form of ABCD matrices and covariant wave equations in the form of a Dirac equation for atom optics in the presence of gravito-inertial fields. As examples, we derive the phase shift for the atom gravimeter and the output of an atom laser. Some of the physics of the beam splitters is described. We present a second-quantized field theory of massive spin one-half particles or antiparticles in the presence of a weak gravitational field treated as a spin two external field in a flat Minkowski background. This theory is used to calculate and discuss relativistic phase shifts in the context of matter-wave interferometry (especially atom or antiatom interferometry). In this way, many effects are introduced in a unified relativistic framework, including spin-gravitation terms: gravitational red shift, Thomas precession, Sagnac effect, spin-rotation effect, orbital and spin Lense-Thirring effects, de Sitter geodetic precession and finally the effect of gravitational waves.},

@article{Teich:1992qe,
	Abstract = {An open quantum system is usually characterized by a reduced ensemble density matrix, the dynamics of which is governed by a generalized Master equation. Transforming this equation of motion into the instantaneous diagonal basis of the corresponding reduced density matrix, we can separate the coherent and incoherent part of the dynamics: The coherent dynamics is incorporated in the time development of the diagonal basis states, while the coupling to the reservoirs leads to simple rate equations. Interpreting these rate equations as a stochastic point process allows one to simulate the stochastic time evolution (random telegraph signals, ``quantum jumps'') of single-quantum systems. The diagonal representation can be considered as a generalization of the dressed-state picture of open quantum systems. Numerical simulations (``quantum Monte Carlo'') allow one to derive various dynamical properties (including correlation functions) of single-quantum systems. This concept is applied to different two- and three-level scenarios (λ and ν configuration), and its limitations are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Localized scattering phenomena may result in the formation of stationary matter waves originating from a compact region in physical space. Mathematically, such waves are advantageously expressed in terms of quantum sources that are introduced into the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The source formalism yields direct access to the scattering wavefunction, particle distribution and total current. As an example, we study emission from three-dimensional Gaussian sources into a homogeneous force field. This model describes the behaviour of an atom laser supplied by an ideal Bose-Einstein condensate under the influence of gravity. We predict a strong dependence of the beam profile on the condensate size and the presence of interference phenomena recently observed in photodetachment experiments. },

	Abstract = {We present a three-dimensional quantum-mechanical theory of radio-frequency-outcoupled atom lasers from trapped atomic gases in the presence of the gravitational force. Predictions for the total outcoupling rate as a function of the radio frequency and for the beam wave function are given. We establish a sum rule for the energy-integrated outcoupling, which leads to a separate determination of the coupling strength between the atoms and radiation field. For a noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate analytic solutions are derived which are subsequently extended to include the effects of atomic interactions. The interactions enhance interference effects in the beam profile and modify the outcoupling rate of the atom laser. We provide a complete quantum-mechanical solution which is in line with experimental findings and allows us to determine the validity of commonly used approximative methods. We also extend the formalism to a fermionic atom laser and analyze the effect of superfluidity on the outcoupling of atoms.},

@article{Wiseman:2002rf,
	Abstract = {As discussed in the preceding paper [Wiseman and Vaccaro, preceding paper, Phys. Rev. A 65, 043605 (2002)], the stationary state of an optical or atom laser far above threshold is a mixture of coherent field states with random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number states. We are interested in which, if either, of these descriptions of ρss as a stationary ensemble of pure states, is more natural. In the preceding paper we concentrated upon the question of whether descriptions such as these are physically realizable (PR). In this paper we investigate another relevant aspect of these ensembles, their robustness. A robust ensemble is one for which the pure states that comprise it survive relatively unchanged for a long time under the system evolution. We determine numerically the most robust ensembles as a function of the parameters in the laser model: the self-energy χ of the bosons in the laser mode, and the excess phase noise ν. We find that these most robust ensembles are PR ensembles, or similar to PR ensembles, for all values of these parameters. In the ideal laser limit (ν=χ=0), the most robust states are coherent states. As the phase noise or phase dispersion is increased through ν or the self-interaction of the bosons χ, respectively, the most robust states become more and more amplitude squeezed. We find scaling laws for these states, and give analytical derivations for them. As the phase diffusion or dispersion becomes so large that the laser output is no longer quantum coherent, the most robust states become so squeezed that they cease to have a well-defined coherent amplitude. That is, the quantum coherence of the laser output is manifest in the most robust PR ensemble being an ensemble of states with a well-defined coherent amplitude. This lends support to our approach of regarding robust PR ensembles as the most natural description of the state of the laser mode. It also has interesting implications for atom lasers in particular, for which phase dispersion due to self-interactions is expected to be large.},

@article{Wiseman:2002mz,
	Abstract = {A laser, be it an optical laser or an atom laser, is an open quantum system that produces a coherent beam of bosons (photons or atoms, respectively). Far above threshold, the stationary state ρss of the laser mode is a mixture of coherent-field states with random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number states. This paper answers the question: can descriptions such as these, of ρss as a stationary ensemble of pure states, be physically realized? Here physical realization is as defined previously by us [H. M. Wiseman and J. A. Vaccaro, Phys. Lett. A 250, 241 (1998)]: an ensemble of pure states for a particular system can be physically realized if, without changing the dynamics of the system, an experimenter can (in principle) know at any time that the system is in one of the pure-state members of the ensemble. Such knowledge can be obtained by monitoring the baths to which the system is coupled, provided that coupling is describable by a Markovian master equation. Using a family of master equations for the (atom) laser, we solve for the physically realizable (PR) ensembles. We find that for any finite self-energy χ of the bosons in the laser mode, the coherent-state ensemble is not PR; the closest one can come to it is an ensemble of squeezed states. This is particularly relevant for atom lasers, where the self-energy arising from elastic collisions is expected to be large. By contrast, the number-state ensemble is always PR. As the self-energy χ increases, the states in the PR ensemble closest to the coherent-state ensemble become increasingly squeezed. Nevertheless, there are values of χ for which states with well-defined coherent amplitudes are PR, even though the atom laser is not coherent (in the sense of having a Bose-degenerate output). We discuss the physical significance of this anomaly in terms of conditional coherence (and hence conditional Bose degeneracy).},

[Nature (London) 390, 575 (1997)] and the adjustments to it suggested by Braunstein and Kimble [Nature (London) 394, 841 (1998)]. These suggestions include the employment of a detector cascade and a relative slow-down of one of the two down-converters. We show that coincidences between photon pairs from parametric down-conversion automatically probe the non-Poissonian structure of these sources. Furthermore, we find that detector cascading is of limited use, and that modifying the relative strengths of the down-conversion efficiencies will increase the time of the experiment to the order of weeks. Our analysis therefore points to the benefits of single-photon detectors in non post selected-type experiments, a technology currently requiring roughly 6 $\,^{\circ}$K operating conditions.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the quantum evolution of a particle moving in a potential in interaction with an environment of harmonic oscillators in a thermal state, using the quantum state diffusion (QSD) picture of Gisin and Percival. The QSD picture exploits mathematical connection between the usual Markovian master equation for the evolution of the density operator and a class of stochastic nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations (Ito equations) for a pure state ‖ψ〉, and appears to supply a good description of individual systems and processes. We find approximate stationary solutions to the Ito equation (exact, for the case of quadratic potentials). The solutions are Gaussians, localized around a point in phase space undergoing classical Brownian motion. We show, for quadratic potentials, that every initial state approaches these stationary solutions in the long time limit. We recover the density operator corresponding to these solutions, and thus show, for this particular model, that the QSD picture effectively supplies a prescription for approximately diagonalizing the density operator in a basis of phase space localized states. We show that the rate of localization is related to the decoherence time, and also to the time scale on which thermal and quantum fluctuations become comparable. We use these results to exemplify the general connection between the QSD picture and the decoherent histories approach to quantum mechanics, discussed previously by Di{\'o}si, Gisin, Halliwell, and Percival.},

	Abstract = {We consider the behavior of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of an atom in an (internal) excited electronic level. We analyze the boson-accumulation regime, defined by the relation N0{\gg}a,N-N0, where N is the total number of atoms in the ground electronic state, N0 is the number of atoms in the condensate, and a is the number of levels to which the excited atom can decay. In this regime, quantum statistical effects related to the boson nature of the atoms are predominant in the process of spontaneous emission. Simple arguments suggest that the proportion of atoms in the condensate decreases after the spontaneous decay. A more elaborated model based on a master equation description shows that, in general, these arguments may lead to erroneous conclusions. Under certain conditions it predicts that the proportion of atoms in the condensate increases. We give an interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of quantum interferences between processes that include reabsorption of the emitted photons, and dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms. The physical effect considered here may help to pump atoms into a condensate and to compensate for atomic losses in the atomic trap.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that the evolution of an open quantum system whose density operator obeys a Markovian master equation can in some cases be meaningfully described in terms of stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations (SSE's) for its state vector. A necessary condition for this is that the information carried away from the system by the bath (source of the irreversibility) be recoverable. The primary field of application is quantum optics, where the bath consists of the continuum of electromagnetic modes. The information lost from the system can be recovered using a perfect photodetector. The state of the system conditioned on the photodetections undergoes stochastic quantum jumps. Alternative measurement schemes on the outgoing light (homodyne and heterodyne detection) are shown to give rise to SSE's with diffusive terms. These three detection schemes are illustrated on a simple quantum system, the two-level atom, giving new perspectives on the interpretation of measurement results. The reality of these and other stochastic processes for state vectors is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The stochastic dynamics of the quantum state of a laser conditioned on continuous intensity and phase-sensitive measurements on its output are examined. We first develop the essential model for a Poissonian laser, and then generalize it for regularly pumped lasers. We show that the rate of phase diffusion (which gives the laser linewidth) is not affected by the regularity of the pump. In both cases, heterodyne detection causes the phase variance in the conditioned laser state to become very small, yet remain significantly above (at least three times) that of a coherent state. The phase diffusion is manifest by a random walk undertaken by the mean phase, with the stochasticity arising from the local-oscillator shot noise. In contrast, intensity measurements have no effect on a Poissonian laser. For a perfectly regularly pumped laser, coarse-grained intensity measurements (for which an approximate theory is developed here) collapse the state to one with an arbitrarily small photon-number variance-to-mean ratio.},

	Abstract = {In this Einstein Year of Physics it seems appropriate to look at an important aspect of Einstein's work that is often down-played: his contribution to the debate on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Contrary to physics `folklore', Bohr had no defence against Einstein's 1935 attack (the EPR paper) on the claimed completeness of orthodox quantum mechanics. I suggest that Einstein's argument, as stated most clearly in 1946, could justly be called Einstein's reality -- locality -- completeness theorem, since it proves that one of these three must be false. Einstein's instinct was that completeness of orthodox quantum mechanics was the falsehood, but he failed in his quest to find a more complete theory that respected reality and locality. Einstein's theorem, and possibly Einstein's failure, inspired John Bell in 1964 to prove his reality -- locality theorem. This strengthened Einstein's theorem (but showed the futility of his quest) by demonstrating that either reality or locality is a falsehood. This revealed the full non-locality of the quantum world for the first time.},

	Abstract = {A quantum theory of an optical maser was developed in the first paper of this series, in which the active medium is made up of static two-level atoms excited in their upper level while the damping atoms are taken in their lower level. The theory was extended in the fourth paper by generalizing to finite atomic and cavity temperatures, and the frequency pulling and pushing relations were also derived. In the present paper we extend the work of the previous papers by allowing the lasing atoms to have thermal motion. Recoil of the atoms due to photon emission or absorption is also considered, and its effect on the laser threshold and operating frequency is given. The influence of the atomic motion on the photon statistics, frequency shift, and line shape of the laser radiation is shown explicitly.},

	Abstract = {In Paper I of this series, we derived equations of motion for a quantum-laser field interacting with atomic reservoirs. In the usual region of sustained oscillation, the off-diagonal elements of the radiation density matrix ρn,n+k(t) were found to have an expontential decay associated with phase diffusion. In I we found the spectrum of the laser radiation by calculating the single time-ensemble average electric field implied by ρn,n+1(t). This electric field was then treated as a classical variable whose Fourier analysis gave the spectrum. In the present paper, we establish the validity of this procedure by analyzing a simple model for a spectrometer. It is also shown that the same spectrum can be obtained from a two-time correlation function derived from the equations of motion.},

	Abstract = {A quantum statistical analysis of an optical maser is presented in generalization of the recent semiclassical theory of Lamb. Equations of motion for the density matrix of the quantized electromagnetic field are derived. These equations describe the irreversible dynamics of the laser radiation in all regions of operation (above, below, and at threshold). Nonlinearities play an essential role in this problem. The diagonal equations of motion for the radiation are found to have an apparent physical interpretation. At steady state, these equations may be solved via detailed-balance considerations to yield the photon statistical distribution ρn,n. The resulting distribution has a variance which is significantly larger than that for coherent light. The off-diagonal elements of the radiation density matrix describe the effects of phase diffusion in general and provide the spectral profile | E(ω) |2 as a special case. A detailed discussion of the physics involved in this paper is given in the concluding sections. The theory of the laser adds another example to the short list of solved problems in irreversible quantum statistical mechanics.},

@article{Greiner:2002fk,
	Abstract = {A Bose-Einstein condensate represents the most 'classical' form of a matter wave, just as an optical laser emits the most classical form of an electromagnetic wave. Nevertheless, the matter wave field has a quantized structure owing to the granularity of the discrete underlying atoms. Although such a field is usually assumed to be intrinsically stable (apart from incoherent loss processes), this is no longer true when the condensate is in a coherent superposition of different atom number states1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For example, in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined by a three-dimensional optical lattice, each potential well can be prepared in a coherent superposition of different atom number states, with constant relative phases between neighbouring lattice sites. It is then natural to ask how the individual matter wave fields and their relative phases evolve. Here we use such a set-up to investigate these questions experimentally, observing that the matter wave field of the Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a periodic series of collapses and revivals; this behaviour is directly demonstrated in the dynamical evolution of the multiple matter wave interference pattern. We attribute the oscillations to the quantized structure of the matter wave field and the collisions between individual atoms.},

	Abstract = {For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

The zero-order approximation gives the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equations. In the next order we recover the truncated Wigner approximation, where the evolution is still classical but the initial conditions are distributed according to the Wigner transform of the initial density matrix. Further corrections can be characterized as quantum scattering events, which appear in the form of a nonlinear response of the observable to an infinitesimal displacement of the field along its classical evolution. At the end of the paper we give a few numerical examples to test the formalism.},

	Abstract = {It is shown that provided two devices are distinguishable, their electromagnetic interactions are in essence classical. This results in the existence of simple correspondence rules connecting q- and c-number statistical descriptions of macroscopic optical arrangements. These rules allow formulas found by c-number techniques to be used as precise quantum relations. For the vast majority of real devices, including all linear devices and real light detectors regardless of their internal system, their c-number macroscopic description can be directly employed in QED. The problem of locality of QED is discussed and a rigorous theory of electrical-feedback arrangements in optics is presented.},

The stationary as well as the dynamical properties of the model are calculated directly from the quantum master equation with the help of two numerical methods. These numerical methods do not need any quasi-probability representation and they do not require approximations. We find that the one-atom laser exhibits most of the typical features of a normal laser. In the region far below threshold some aspects, among them the linewidth, are changed due to eigenvalues of the master equation with imaginary parts. In this regime the complexity of the eigenvalues prominently enters the dynamical behavior.},

	Abstract = {The functional Fokker-Planck formalism developed in a preceding paper is applied to the problem of a radiation field propagating in a medium, which contains resonant two-level atoms. Besides the electromagnetic field also the medium is described by continuous space dependent fields. We give the masterequation and transform it into ac-number functional differential equation for a characteristic functional. This equation is reduced considerably by the projection onto one dimension and the introduction of the diffusion approximation. It forms a solid basis for the study of all types of light propagation in resonant media including classical and quantum noise.
We give an approximate solution of this equation by considering the problem of an externally pumped optical transmission line, in the case that saturation effects are absent. The spectral function of the electric field strength is obtained which describes a statistical mixture of photons with the quasiparticles of the polarization field. It shows the onset of a condensation of the quasiparticles into a single state. Self excitation of the transmission line is obtained at a certain threshold of the atomic inversion. This threshold is characterized by a finite occupation number of one single quasiparticle state. The influence of a finite length of the transmission line is briefly considered.},

	Abstract = {The quantum statistics of continuous space time dependent electromagnetic fields is analyzed by means of functionals. The case of a field propagating in a thermal reservoir serves as a simple example to illustrate the succeeding steps: a masterequation is derived for the density operator which is a functional of the field operators. By means of the coherent state representation for continuous fields the masterequation is transformed into a functional differential equation in the function space, spanned by the coherent state amplitudes. This equation is of the Fokker-Planck type and determines a Gaussian process for a continuum of variables or a field. It is solved by determining the characteristics in function space of the associated equation of motion for the characteristic functional and subsequent functional integration. The solution is used to calculate some correlation functions and the spectral function of the field.},

We derive evolution equations for a single trapped condensate in both the positive-P and Wigner representations and perform simulations to compare the predictions of the two methods. The positive-P approach is found to be highly susceptible to the stability problems that have been observed in other strongly nonlinear, weakly damped systems. Using the Wigner representation, we examine the evolution of several quantities of interest using from a variety of choices of initial state for the condensate and compare results to those for single-mode models.},
	Annote = {This paper talks about the functional Fokker-Planck equation, and how to use it to obtain a multimode stochastic system of equations.

Ref [13] looks at quantised vortex formation. Probably interesting.
Refs [14,15] look at the effect of nonlinearities on quantum noise leading to "interesting statistical properties"
Refs [36-38] talk about the path-integral representations of quantum field averages.
Ref [38] talks about freedom (gauge-freedom?) in the noise term.
Ref [44] talks about the truncated-Wigner representation (the original paper?)

Only two-time averages can be calculated with the Wigner function.

This paper also talks about computation of multitime averages from the Wigner function.
Ref [14] also talks about the functional derivative operator correspondences.

Ref [14] is, of course, Gardiner's Quantum Noise},

	Abstract = {We present a stochastic theory of the renormalization-group transformations of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model, describing a system which exhibits the characteristics of a second-order phase transition. We eliminate a certain range of the Fourier components of the magnetic spin variables via a projection-operator method. This effectively changes the scale of the system and transforms the coupling constants. The procedure is shown to be equivalent to the integration over short-wavelength modes as in the renormalization-group transformation performed by Wilson and Kogut. This equivalence shows that the projection-operator method is a valid procedure for scaling critical systems, and in particular it indicates that the treatment of fluctuations is systematic. We suggest that such a method should also provide a straightforward approach to the dynamic renormalization group.},

	Abstract = {We develop a stochastic theory of rapidly diffusing spatially distributed systems. Discussion is within the framework of the cell model, in which the system is described in terms of a lattice of n cells. Utilizing projector-operator techniques, we formalize the method of homogenization of such systems. That is, by projecting out high-q Fourier modes in the adiabatic limit of large diffusion, we map the system to one defined on a coarser-grained lattice. We thus demonstrate a "blocking" procedure in the cell model. Finally we consider a simple hydrodynamic model and show that near the point of convective instability projection-operation methods predict the same amplitude equations for the slow hydrodynamic modes as does the method of multiple scales.},

In particular, we investigate the applicability of the quantum optical Born-Markov master equation for describing output coupling. We derive conditions based on the atomic reservoir and atom dispersion relations for when the Born-Markov approximations are valid and discuss parameter regimes where these approximations fail in our atom laser model. Differences between the standard optical laser model and the atom laser are due to a combination of factors, including the parameter regimes in which a typical atom laser would operate, the different reservoir state that is appropriate for atoms, and the different dispersion relations between atoms and photons. We present results based on an exact method in the regimes in which the Born-Markov approximation fails. The exact solutions in some experimentally relevant parameter regimes give a nonexponential loss of atoms from a cavity.},

	Abstract = {We present a fully quantum-mechanical treatment of a single-mode atomic cavity with a pumping mechanism and an output coupling to a continuum of external modes. This system is a schematic description of an atom laser. In the dilute limit where atom-atom interactions are negligible, we have been able to solve this model without making the Born and Markov approximations. When coupling into free space, it is shown that for reasonable parameters there is a bound state which does not disperse, which means that there is no steady state. This bound state does not exist when gravity is included, and in that case the system reaches a steady state. We develop equations of motion for the two-time correlation in the presence of pumping and gravity in the output modes. We then calculate the energy spectrum of the steady-state output flux from the laser. We present a ``self-consistent Markov approximation'' which allows efficient calculation of this energy spectrum well above threshold.},

We show that for any available control, there is an associated moment of the atomic density and a feedback scheme that will remove energy from the system while there are oscillations in that moment. We demonstrate these schemes by considering a condensate trapped in a harmonic potential that can be modulated in strength and position. The formalism of our feedback scheme also allows the inclusion of certain types of nonlinear controls. If the nonlinear interaction between the atoms can be controlled via a Feshbach resonance, we show that the feedback process can operate with a much higher efficiency.},

This derivation does not rely on the concept of local energy and momentum conservation and is based on a quasiclassical Wigner function representation of a \&lsquo;high temperature\&rsquo; master equation for a Bose gas, which includes only modes below an energy cut-off E $_{ R }$ that are sufficiently highly occupied (the condensate band). The modes above this cut-off (the non-condensate band) are treated as being essentially thermalized. The interaction between these two bands, known as growth and scattering processes, provides noise and damping terms in the equation of motion for the condensate band, which we call the stochastic Gross\&ndash;Pitaevskii equation. This approach is distinguished by the control of the approximations made in its derivation and by the feasibility of its numerical implementation. },

	Abstract = {We show how to adapt the ideas of local energy and momentum conservation in order to derive modifications to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation which can be used phenomenologically to describe irreversible effects in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Our approach involves the derivation of a simplified quantum kinetic theory, in which all processes are treated locally. It is shown that this kinetic theory can then be transformed into a number of phase-space representations, of which the Wigner function description, although approximate, is shown to be the most advantageous. In this description, the quantum kinetic master equation takes the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with noise and damping added according to a well defined prescription - an equation we call the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation . From this, a very simplified description we call the phenomenological growth equation can be derived. We use this equation to study~(i) the nucleation and growth of vortex lattices, and~(ii) nonlinear losses in a hydrogen condensate, which it is shown can lead to a curious instability phenomenon. },

	Abstract = {We study the truncated Wigner method applied to a weakly interacting spinless Bose-condensed gas which is perturbed away from thermal equilibrium by a time-dependent external potential. The principle of the method is to generate an ensemble of classical fields \&psi;( r ) which samples the Wigner quasi-distribution function of the initial thermal equilibrium density operator of the gas, and then to evolve each classical field with the Gross\&ndash;Pitaevskii equation. In the first part of the paper we improve the sampling technique over our previous work (Sinatra et al 2000 J. Mod. Opt.  47 2629\&ndash;44) and we test its accuracy against the exactly solvable model of the ideal Bose gas. In the second part of the paper we investigate the conditions of validity of the truncated Wigner method. For short evolution times it is known that the time-dependent Bogoliubov approximation is valid for almost pure condensates. The requirement that the truncated Wigner method reproduces the Bogoliubov prediction leads to the constraint that the number of field modes in the Wigner simulation must be smaller than the number of particles in the gas. For longer evolution times the nonlinear dynamics of the noncondensed modes of the field plays an important role. To demonstrate this we analyse the case of a three-dimensional spatially homogeneous Bose-condensed gas and we test the ability of the truncated Wigner method to correctly reproduce the Beliaev\&ndash;Landau damping of an excitation of the condensate. We have identified the mechanism which limits the validity of the truncated Wigner method: the initial ensemble of classical fields, driven by the time-dependent Gross\&ndash;Pitaevskii equation, thermalizes to a classical field distribution at a temperature  T $_{class}$ which is larger than the initial temperature  T  of the quantum gas. When  T $_{class}$ significantly exceeds  T  a spurious damping is observed in the Wigner simulation. This leads to the second validity condition for the truncated Wigner method,  T $_{class}$ \&minus; T \&ll; T  , which requires that the maximum energy \&epsilon;$_{max}$ of the Bogoliubov modes in the simulation does not exceed a few  k $_{ B }$ T  . },

	Abstract = {Superconductivity, superfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and laser amplification are all examples of a general mechanism involving the stimulated transfer of bosons into a specific quantum state. When the occupation number of the state is large, this mechanism may generate a macroscopic coherence for the state amplitude. In this paper, we demonstrate that the stimulated transfer of bosonic atoms into a given state of an optical or a magnetic trap can give rise to a coherent atomic source in analogy with the photon laser and we present a general model for such a device.},

We observe a transverse structure containing caustics that vary with the density within the residing BEC. Using the WKB approximation, Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral formalism, and ABCD matrices, we are able to describe analytically the atom-laser propagation. This allows us to characterize the quality of the nonideal atom-laser beam by a generalized M2 factor defined in analogy to photon lasers. Finally we measure this quality factor for different lensing effects.},

We determine the regime in which the assumptions of the simple model of Gardiner et al. [Phys. Rev.

We find good agreement with our earlier modeling, except at higher condensate fractions, for which a significant speedup is found. We also investigate the effect of the final temperature on condensate growth, and find that this has a surprisingly small effect. The particular discrepancy between theory and experiment found in our earlier model remains, since the speedup found in these computations does not occur in the parameter regime specified in the experiment.},

	Abstract = {A detailed analysis of the growth of a Bose-Einstein condensate is given, based on quantum kinetic theory, in which we take account of the evolution of the occupations of lower trap levels, and of the full Bose-Einstein formula for the occupations of higher trap levels, as well as the Bose-stimulated direct transfer of atoms to the condensate level introduced by Gardiner et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 1793 (1997); 81, 5266 (1998)]. We find good agreement with experiment at higher temperatures, but at lower temperatures the experimentally observed growth rate is somewhat more rapid. We also confirm the picture of the ``kinetic'' region of evolution, introduced by Kagan, Svistunov, and Shlyapnikov (Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 101, 528 (1992) [Sov. Phys. JETP 75, 387 (1992)]), for the time up to the initiation of the condensate. The behavior after initiation essentially follows our original growth equation, but with a substantially increased rate coefficient. Our modeling of growth implicitly gives a model of the spatial shape of the density profile of the condensate-vapor system as the condensate grows, and thus provides an alternative to the present phenomenological fitting procedure, based on the sum of a zero-chemical potential vapor and a Thomas-Fermi-shaped condensate. Our method gives substantially different results for condensate numbers and temperatures obtained from phenomenological fits, but fits the published column density data very well.},

The system is divided in a condensate and a noncondensate part. A quantum-mechanical description based on the number-conserving Bogoliubov method is used for describing the condensate part. The noncondensed particles are treated as a classical gas in thermal equilibrium with temperature T and chemical potential ?. We find a master equation for the reduced density operator of the Bose-Einstein condensate, calculate the steady state of the system, and investigate the effect of one-, two-, and three-particle losses on the condensate. Using linearized Ito equations, we find expressions for the intensity fluctuations and the amplitude fluctuations in the condensate. A Lorentzian line shape is found for the intensity correlation function that is characterized by a time constant ?I-1 derived in the paper. For the amplitude correlation function, we find ballistic behavior for time differences smaller than ?I-1, and diffusive behavior for larger time differences.},

	Abstract = {We extend quantum kinetic theory to deal with a strongly Bose-condensed atomic vapor in a trap. The method assumes that the majority of the vapor is not condensed, and acts as a bath of heat and atoms for the condensate. The condensate is described by the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method developed by one of the authors. We derive equations which describe the fluctuations of particle number and phase, and the growth of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The equilibrium state of the condensate is a mixture of states with different numbers of particles and quasiparticles. It is not a quantum superposition of states with different numbers of particles---nevertheless, the stationary state exhibits the property of off-diagonal long-range order, to the extent that this concept makes sense in a tightly trapped condensate.},
	Annote = {The particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov method is in ref [14]. This discusses the distinction between the creation/destruction of condensate-band particles and quasi-particles.

The Born approximation (Ref [18]) is related to the use of a delta function as the interatomic potential.

Ref [16] discusses the back-action on the non-condensate},

Lett. 79, 1793 (1997)] of condensate growth, we take account of the evolution of the occupations of lower trap levels, and of the full Bose-Einstein formula for the occupations of higher trap levels. We find good agreement with experiment, especially at higher temperatures. We also confirm the picture of the ``kinetic'' region of evolution, introduced by Kagan et al., for the time up to the initiation of the condensate. The behavior after initiation essentially follows our original growth equation, but with a substantially increased rate coefficient W+.},

The QBME is the simplest version of a quantum kinetic master equation derived in previous work. We consider two cases of trapping potentials: a three-dimensional square-well potential with periodic boundary conditions and an isotropic harmonic oscillator. We discuss the stationary solutions and relaxation to equilibrium. In particular, we calculate particle distribution functions, fluctuations in the occupation numbers, the time between collisions, and the mean occupation numbers of the one-particle states in the regime of onset of Bose condensation. },

It is a quantum stochastic equation for the kinetics of a dilute quantum Bose gas, and describes the behavior and formation of Bose condensation. The key assumption in deriving the QKME is a Markov approximation for the atomic collision terms. In the present paper the basic structure of the theory is developed, and approximations are stated and justified to delineate the region of validity of the theory. Limiting cases of the QKME include the quantum Boltzmann master equation and the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, as well as an equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.},

@article{Shore:1993uz,
	Abstract = {The Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), a soluble fully quantum mechanical model of an atom in a field, was first used (in 1963) to examine the classical aspects of spontaneous emission and to reveal the existence of Rabi oscillations in atomic excitation probabilities for fields with sharply defined energy (or photon number). For fields having a statistical distributions of photon numbers the oscillations collapse to an expected steady value. In 1980 it was discovered that with appropriate initial conditions (e.g. a near-classical field), the Rabi oscillations would eventually revive, only to collapse and revive repeatedly in a complicated pattern. The existence of these revivals, present in the analytic solutions of the JCM, provided direct evidence for discreteness of field excitation (photons) and hence for the truly quantum nature of radiation. Subsequent study revealed further non-classical properties of the JCM field, such as a tendency of the photons to antibunch. Within the last two years it has been found that during the quiescent intervals of collapsed Rabi oscillations the atom and field exist in a macroscopic superposition state (a Schr{\"o}dinger cat). This discovery offers the opportunity to use the JCM to elucidate the basic properties of quantum correlation (entanglement) and to explore still further the relationship between classical and quantum physics. The relative simplicity of the JCM and the ease with which it can be extended through analytic expressions or numerical computation continues to motivate attention, as evidenced by the growing abundance of publications. We here present an overview of the theory of the JCM and some of the many extensions and generalizations that have appeared.},

	Abstract = {An atom laser is an as-yet unrealized device that would produce an atomic field analogous to the electromagnetic field of a photon laser. Here I argue that for this analogy to be meaningful it is necessary to have a precise definition of a laser that applies equally to photon or atom (or any other boson) lasers. The definition I propose uses the fundamental principle that the output of a laser is well approximated by a classical wave of fixed intensity and phase. This principle yields four quantitative conditions that the output of a device must satisfy in order for the device to be considered a laser. While explaining these requirements, I analyze the similarities and differences between atom and photon lasers. I next show how these conditions are satisfied first by an idealized photon laser model, and then by a more general model that can apply to atom lasers also. Lastly, I briefly discuss the current proposals for atom lasers and whether they could be true lasers.},

	Abstract = {We present a steady-state analysis of a quantum-mechanical model of an atom laser. A single-mode atomic trap coupled to a continuum of external modes is driven by a saturable pumping mechanism. In the dilute flux regime, where atom-atom interactions are negligible in the output, we find an analytic form for the linewidth and frequency shift of the laser. This result does not make the Born-Markov approximation, but is based on the far less restrictive ``self-consistent Markov approximation.'' The more exact treatment has a different effective damping rate and occupation of the lasing mode, as well as a shifted frequency and linewidth of the output. We examine gravitational damping numerically, finding linewidths and frequency shifts for a range of pumping rates. We treat mean-field damping analytically, finding a memory function for the Thomas-Fermi regime. The occupation and linewidth are found to have a nonlinear scaling behavior which has implications for the stability of atom lasers.},

For a spatially independent coupling process it is found that the system is unstable below a critical scattering length. As large atomic interactions will increase the phase diffusion of the lasing mode, it is desirable to obtain a stable atom laser with low nonlinearity. It is shown that spatially dependent pumping stabilizes the atom laser to a finite number of modes, and can induce single-mode operation.},

	Abstract = {A multimode model of a continuously pumped atom laser is shown to be unstable below a critical value of the scattering length. Above the critical scattering length, the atom laser reaches a steady state, the stability of which increases with pumping. Below this limit the laser does not reach a steady state. This instability results from the competition between gain and loss for the excited states of the lasing mode. It will determine a fundamental limit for the linewidth of an atom laser beam.},

	Abstract = {In this tutorial we present an introduction to some theoretical methods of quantum field theory applied to the description of a trapped Bose Einstein condensate. First of all, we give a brief account of the main characteristics of the phenomenon of condensation and present the many-body Hamiltonian of the system. We outline some of the most important approaches used in the characterization of a condensed Bose gas, including the mean-field theory and the Hartree Fock Bogoliubov method. Finally we illustrate the use of these techniques addressing some important issues in quantum atom optics. We characterize the quantum state of a Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) at zero temperature. We also describe a process of Beliaev coupling between quasiparticles using a method that includes terms beyond the usual Bogoliubov approach.},
