It is hard to underestimate the effect that the laser has had since its invention in 1960 \citep{Maiman:1960}.  Although initially motivated by pure scientific curiosity, its unique properties have given it application in an astonishing array of technologies, in addition to its use as a powerful tool in fundamental research.  

Laser radiation is distinguished from the light emitted by everyday light sources --- such as light bulbs --- by three main properties, (i) its narrow divergence, (ii) the narrow range of frequencies that are emitted, and (iii) the low intensity noise of the emitted radiation.  Although many applications only make use of the first property, the second property is critical to its use in such applications as laser gyroscopes, gravitational wave detection and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics\footnote{FIXME: Add citations}.  This second property can also be achieved for thermal light through appropriate spectral filtering, however in practice, lasers are a more convenient method for achieving high spectral intensities.  The third property is the true distinguishing property of a laser, however it is only important in specialised applications (e.g.\ gravitational wave detection), in which intensity fluctuations are a significant noise source\footnote{FIXME: In what other circumstances is $g^{(2)}$ important?}.

Quantum mechanics tells us that not only can light behave as a wave, but atoms can too.  This wave nature of atoms is usually indiscernible because the typical wavelength for a thermal atom is many orders of magnitude smaller than the inter-atomic spacing ($\lambda \sim 5 \times\unit[10^{-11}]{m}$ as compared to $d \sim 3 \times\unit[10^{-9}]{m}$).  However, in 1925 Einstein predicted \citep{Einstein:1925} that if a gas of \emph{bosons} (a class of particles which includes many atomic species) was cooled below a critical temperature, a large fraction of the particles would occupy the ground state of the system, forming a coherent wavefunction.  This was achieved in 1995 for dilute atomic gases \citep{Anderson:1995vn,Bradley:1995ys,Davis:1995} with the first production of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), a macroscopic occupation of atoms in a single spatial mode.  As it is the macroscopic occupation of \emph{photons} in a single spatial mode that gives the optical laser many of its properties, with the achievement of BEC it has become possible to consider the creation of an atomic analogue of the optical laser: the \emph{atom} laser.

An atom laser, while ideally sharing the above properties of its optical cousin, would behave very differently to an optical laser.  While photons interact strongly with matter, they interact only weakly with themselves or with gravity.  While this makes lasers robust to fluctuations in electromagnetic or gravitational fields, they are therefore less sensitive to these fields in interferometry experiments.  Despite this limitation, optical interferometry has been used in several incredible gravitational experiments, including GRACE, LIGO, and Gravity Probe-A \citep{Vessot:1980}.

As atoms interact more readily with their environment than photons, atom interferometry has a broad range of applications: to the measurement of electric and magnetic fields in tests of atom and neutron charge neutrality \citep{Arvanitaki:2008}, an application which would be essentially impossible with optical lasers due to the weak photon--photon interaction; to fundamental tests of predictions of General Relativity \citep{Dimopoulos:2007uq}; to the development of gyroscopes \citep{Gustavson:1997}, gradiometers \citep{Snadden:1998,McGuirk:2002} and gravimeters \citep{Peters:2001}, which, while possible using optical lasers, their atomic counterparts are far more compact due to the significantly stronger gravitational interaction.

Discussion of cold thermal atom interferometry, and how this can be improved through the use of atom lasers.  In particular, space-based applications where the interrogation time is larger \citep{Le-Coq:2006}, therefore we need a greater control over the velocity distribution, and therefore $g^{(1)}$.

FIXME: The basic plan for this section: lasers are cool, now that we have BEC, wouldn't it be cool to have an atom laser.  Optical lasers have great application to interferometry, atoms behave differently and have advantages and disadvantages for interferometry applications.  In certain circumstances, we will need atom-laser based matter-wave interferometry, not just thermal atom interferometry.  Fundamentally, this is about the degree of control.  In the far future, if we want entangled matter-wave sources, we have better prospects using a condensed source like an atom laser.

\section{Photon lasers and Atom lasers}
\label{Introduction:PhotonAndAtomLasers}

The basic features necessary of a continuous atom laser are analogous to the features of a continuous photon laser: a resonant, a lasing mode, an outcoupling process, and a Bose-stimulated pumping mechanism (see \figureref{Introduction:LaserAtomLaserComparison}).  The first three of these features are well understood for an atom laser; experimentally realising the fourth, the pumping mechanism, has presented the greatest challenge.

\subsection{The resonator}

In a photon laser, the resonator is typically a cavity formed between two (or more) mirrors trapping the photons with a region of space; the optical mode trapped within the resonator is the lasing mode.  For atom laser, the resonator is an `atom trap', either an optical trap using the ac Stark shift to trap the atoms in a region of high optical intensity, or a magnetic trap using the Zeeman shift to selectively trap certain magnetic hyperfine states near a local minimum of the magnetic field.

\subsection{The lasing mode}

\begin{figure}

    }
\end{figure}

The necessary property for the lasing mode of a laser --- be it optical or atomic --- is that it have an occupation much greater than one \citep{Wiseman:1997ba}.  For photons, such a highly-degenerate mode was first achieved with the development of the photon laser itself \citep{Maiman:1960,Javan:1961}; a photon condensate cannot exist in equilibrium as total photon number is not conserved \citep{Muller:1986,Ketterle:1999fk}.  Total atom number is, however, conserved and Bose-Einstein condensation occurs below a critical temperature \citep{PethickSmith}.  Below this critical temperature, a significant fraction of the atoms in the system occupy a single spatial mode; exactly what is required of the lasing mode of an atom laser.

The process of Bose-Einstein condensation can be understood in a simplified picture in which the atoms are viewed as wave-packets with an extent of the order of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_\text{dB} = (2 \pi \hbar^2 / M k_B T)^{1/2}$, where $M$ is the mass of the atom, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T$ is the temperature of the atoms.  At room temperature, the de Broglie wavelength is sufficiently small ($\sim 5\times\unit[10^{-11}]{m}$ for \nucl{4}{He} at $T=\unit[300]{K}$) that the atoms behave as point-like billiard balls (upper panel of \figureref{Introduction:WhatIsBEC}).  As the temperature decreases, the de Broglie wavelength increases (second panel of \figureref{Introduction:WhatIsBEC}).  As the temperature continues to decrease, the de Broglie wavelength approaches the mean interparticle separation $d$ and the atomic matter waves begin to overlap (third panel of \figureref{Introduction:WhatIsBEC}).  Below this temperature, a Bose-Einstein condensate begins to form, until at $T=0$, all atoms are in the condensate (lower panel of \figureref{Introduction:WhatIsBEC}).  Conservation of total number is necessary for BEC, as it is because of this that the interparticle separation $d$ remains constant as temperature is decreased (in a box of constant volume); for photons, as the temperature is decreased the total number of photons in the system decreases, increasing the mean interparticle separation $d$ faster than the photon wavelength increases.  Hence photon condensation cannot occur in equilibrium.

Bose-Einstein condensation is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon with a broad range of applications beyond the production of atom lasers.  Perhaps the most interesting of these are the development of \emph{quantum simulators} \citep{Lewenstein:2007,Buluta:2009}, experiments which directly realise theoretical condensed matter models, which where initially proposed as approximations to other systems.  For example, the Bose-Hubbard model \citep{Fisher:1989} of interacting bosons was realised by loading a BEC into an optical lattice.  By changing the depth of the optical lattice, the ratio of the tunnelling and interaction terms was be changed, permitting direct observation of the superfluid--Mott insulator transition \citep{Greiner:2002lr}.  Quantum simulators are possible for a variety of other systems, including Josephson junctions \citep{Levy:2007vn}, and reduced-dimensional systems such as the Tonks-Girardeau model of 1D hard core bosons \citep{Girardeau:1960,Lieb:1963,Paredes:2004}.  Dilute gas BECs have also been used in the direct observation of persistent currents in the form of vortices and vortex lattices \citep{Abo-Shaeer:2001}, the coherent control of optical information \citep{Ginsberg:2007fk}, and the observation of quantum optical effects in atoms such as the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss effect \citep{Jeltes:2007fk}, and four-wave mixing \citep{Deng:1999qy}.

One of the advantages of dilute gas BEC that gives these systems such a broad range of applications is the extraordinary degree to which these systems can be controlled and manipulated:  their effective dimensionality can be changed by changing the confining potential; the de Broglie wavelength is controllable over many orders of magnitude $\unit[1]{nm} \lesssim \lambda_\text{dB} \lesssim \unit[10]{\micro m}$; the sign and magnitude of interparticle interactions can be controlled \citep{Inouye:1998hy}, all the way from attractive interactions through to infinitely repulsive interactions, including the non-interacting limit; essentially `pure' potentials (minimal absorption) may be constructed in a range of forms including highly regular potentials such as harmonic or lattice potentials, and random potentials with controllable statistical properties.  Dilute gas BEC also has a range of available observational tools for probing the system including absorptive imaging, phase-contrast imaging, Bragg scattering, and ionisation in the case of metastable species\footnote{FIXME: Missing citations everywhere}.  

The goal of atom optics is to use the fundamental differences between atoms and photons in the application of the principles of laser optics to new fields of research.

\subsection{The outcoupling process}

The outcoupling of light from the lasing mode of a photon laser is achieved by making one of the cavity mirrors partially transmissive.  The emitted light is the output mode of the photon laser.  For atom lasers, an analogous technique can be used in optical traps by lowering the depth of the trap until some atoms can tunnel out of the trap with the assistance of gravity.  In magnetic traps, electromagnetic radiation is applied to transfer the atoms (either directly with radio-frequency radiation \citep{Mewes:1997,Bloch:1999mi}, or indirectly via a multi-photon Raman transition \citep{Moy:1997,Hagley:1999dz,Robins:2006fk}) into a magnetically-insensitive state in which they fall freely under gravity.  These outcoupled atoms form the atom laser beam.

Contemporary atom optics experiments operate in pulsed mode.  Without a pumping mechanism, the atom laser beam is limited by the size of the condensate.  Once all of the atoms in the BEC have been outcoupled, the atom laser beam stops.  This places a fundamental limit on the linewidth (related to the longitudinal velocity-spread) of the atomic pulse produced: the Fourier limit, proportional to the inverse of the outcoupling time \citep{Johnsson:2007}.  This limit can be made arbitrarily small (until the energy uncertainty in the BEC due to interatomic scattering becomes significant \cite{Johnsson:2007a}) at the expense of an arbitrarily low atom flux.  Practically however, this trade-off cannot be made because the signal-to-noise ratio for atom laser experiments depends critically on the atomic flux \citep{Dowling:1998}.  The only way to achieve a high-flux atom laser with a narrow linewidth is with a continuous pumping process, which has yet to be achieved experimentally. 

The outcoupling process for atom lasers displays a range of behaviour.  While intuitively one might expect that increasing the outcoupling strength would continuously increase the atom laser flux, this is only true up to a point.  In the limit of large outcoupling rates a bound state forms \citep{Jeffers:2000rr}, and the atom laser shuts down \citep{Robins:2004pz}.  

The outcoupling process also strongly affects the transverse profile of the atom laser.  Due to the mean-field repulsion the atoms experience as they leave the condensate, significant interference fringes are observed on the atom laser profile \citep{Busch:2002zr,Kohl:2005fk}.  These interference fringes complicate the spatial profile of the atom laser, making any atom interferometry experiment that relies upon separated beam paths more challenging.  The interference fringes on the transverse profile increase the sensitivity of the experiment to imperfections in the spatial overlap of the previously-separated beams when they are combined for detection.  These interference fringes may be reduced by outcoupling from the bottom of the condensate \citep{Riou:2006uq} or by giving the atoms a significant momentum kick as they leave the condensate \citep{Jeppesen:2008}.  The transverse profile of the atom laser is discussed in greater detail in \sectionref{BackgroundTheory:TransverseProfile}.

Even in the absence of a pumping process, atom lasers can be used for a variety of interesting experiments.  The correlation and counting statistics of an atom laser have been measured \citep{Ottl:2005}, an atom laser has been guided with optical waveguides \citep{Guerin:2006mz}, and a BEC has been probed using an atom laser outcoupled from a separate BEC \citep{Doring:2008}.  There have also been interesting theoretical proposals to produce non-classical atom laser states using the interatomic interaction of the atom laser \citep{Johnsson:2007b}, or by outcoupling with squeezed light \citep{Haine:2005}, and a related proposal to generate controllable atom--light entanglement \citep{Haine:2006}.

\subsection{The pumping mechanism}
\label{Introduction:ThePumpingMechanism}

\subsubsection{The photon laser}

The pumping mechanism of a laser acts as an amplifier for the lasing mode.  It is what replenishes the losses of the lasing mode due to outcoupling, and any other loss processes.  Without a pumping mechanism, an optical laser is simply a leaky cavity emitting an exponentially-decreasing amount of light.  The linewidth of this emitted light is limited by the linewidth of the optical cavity.  The pumping mechanism for an optical laser not only permits continuous operation of the laser, it also narrows the linewidth of the laser in a process known as \emph{gain-narrowing}.  Gain-narrowing results from the saturation of the pumping process for large signals; no physical amplifier can amplify a signal indefinitely.  

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{4LevelOpticalLaserModel}
    \caption{
        \label{Introduction:4LevelOpticalLaserModel}
        FIXME: This is not a caption.  Figure shamelessly plagiarised from Figure 13.2-6 of \citep{SalehTeich}.  Note that all levels have been incremented by 1 to avoid confusion with the vacuum state.  Figure needs clarifying, but can stand in for the present.
    }
\end{figure}

A pumping mechanism contains excitations that can each increase the occupation of the lasing mode by one.  These excitations are replenished at a finite rate, limiting the rate at which the lasing mode may be increased.  For example, in the 4-level photon laser model illustrated in \figureref{Introduction:4LevelOpticalLaserModel}, atoms are pumped from the ground state $\ket{1}$ to the short-lived state $\ket{4}$ at a rate $R$.  The atoms in state $\ket{4}$ may decay into the $\ket{3}$ state, the excited state of the lasing transition.  The occupation of the lasing mode can therefore not be increased at a rate greater than $R$.  Any physical pumping mechanism will also exhibit saturation, and therefore the laser mode will exhibit gain-narrowing.

Another necessary property of the pumping mechanism is that it be irreversible; once the occupation of the lasing mode has been increased, the probability that the process will reverse should be negligible.  This is achieved by coupling to a large number of essentially-empty modes known as a \emph{reservoir}.  In the case of the 4-level photon laser model depicted in \figureref{Introduction:4LevelOpticalLaserModel}, once an atom in the excited state of the lasing transition, $\ket{4}$ has undergone spontaneous emission into the $\ket{2}$ state, it rapidly decays into the ground state $\ket{1}$.  By ensuring that the ground state of the lasing transition $\ket{2}$ decays to the true ground state $\ket{0}$ faster than it can absorb a lasing photon, the pumping process is made irreversible.  The reservoir is comprised of the essentially-empty modes of the $\ket{2}$ level, which are kept empty due to their short lifetime.

Finally, in many circumstances it is desirable that the photon laser have only one lasing mode.  It is possible for a laser to support more than one lasing mode as the resonator may support many different modes, and if the gain bandwidth of the pumping mechanism encompasses more than one of these modes, multiple lasing modes may result.  As the photon--photon interaction is negligible, these lasing modes do not directly interact, and may operate independently.  Multiple-mode operation in a photon laser is naturally suppressed if the pumping process is \emph{homogeneously broadened}.  In homogeneously broadened gain media, every excitation of the pumping mechanism contributes to the gain of the lasing modes in the same way, i.e.\ every excitation has the same gain profile.  If the gain medium is \emph{inhomogeneously broadened}, some classes of pumping excitations will contribute differently to the total gain profile than others.  A classic example of this is Doppler-broadening.  Atoms in a gain medium will have a finite temperature, and their motion affects what frequencies they are resonant with in the laboratory frame due to the Doppler effect.  If the size of this frequency is greater than the natural width of the lasing transition, the saturation of those excitations resonant with one lasing mode may not affect the gain experienced by another lasing mode.  In this case, both lasing modes will experience gain independently, each without saturating the other.  If the pumping process is inhomogeneously broadened, undesirable modes can be removed by increasing their loss in the optical resonator.  This is naturally achieved by the addition of a second, smaller cavity inside the resonator that is only resonant with the desired mode.  If the pumping process is homogeneously broadened however, while multiple modes may initially experience gain, only the mode with the largest net gain will survive as the gain saturates, resulting in single-mode operation.


\subsubsection{The atom laser}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{ReservoirChoices}
    \caption{
        \label{Introduction:ReservoirChoices}
        Classes of pumping mechanism for an atom laser as defined by the reservoir. FIXME: This is not a caption.
    }
\end{figure}

There are two choices of reservoir for the pumping mechanism of an atom laser: the empty modes of the optical field, or the empty modes of the atomic field.  Each choice corresponds to a different class of pumping mechanism.  These two classes are illustrated in \figureref{Introduction:ReservoirChoices}.  In the first, an atom in an excited internal state is brought into resonance with the lasing mode such that it can decay into the lasing mode.  It is Bose-stimulated to do so by the occupation of the atomic lasing mode.  Once the emitted photon leaves the system, this decay is irreversible.  In the second, two atoms scatter into different energy states, one goes into the lasing mode, while the other gains sufficient energy to be removed from the system (for example, due to forced evaporation, the same process used in the formation of BEC).

Single-mode operation is not simply desirable for an atom laser, it is necessary.  Due to the large interatomic interactions, multiple lasing modes in an atom laser could not operate independently.  Significant scattering would occur between the lasing modes, increasing the linewidth of both, possibly destroying any laser-like qualities in the process.  While the interatomic interactions can be `switched off' with the use of a Feschbach resonance\footnote{FIXME: Missing citation.}, the loss processes are such that higher energy modes experience \emph{less} loss than the lower modes in this case, making the atom laser unstable \citep{Haine:2002kp}.  This instability can be resolved by increasing the interatomic interactions \citep{Haine:2002kp}, adding a position-dependent loss near the edge of the lasing mode \citep{Kneer:1998fk}, and in the case of non-zero interatomic interactions, by increasing the pumping rate \citep{Robins:2001pd}.

In all of the phenomenological atom laser pumping models discussed in the previous paragraph \citep{Haine:2002kp,Kneer:1998fk,Robins:2001pd}, the gain mechanism was effectively `homogeneously broadened' in the sense that all pumping excitations could contribute equally to the gain of all modes.  This is more difficult to achieve for atom lasers than for photon lasers.  In the case of photon lasers, the dispersion relation (the expression for energy --- or equivalently, frequency --- as a function of wavenumber) for the reservoir is relatively flat by comparison to that of the lasing mode.  This is a useful property, as a greater number of pumping excitations can increase the occupation of the lasing mode if variations in the momentum difference between the pumping excitations and the lasing mode can be compensated for by the reservoir with minimal energy cost.  In the limit of a perfectly flat dispersion relation for the reservoir, any momentum difference between the pumping excitation and the lasing mode can result in gain provided only energy is conserved, and due to the finite lifetime of the pumping excitation, energy need only be conserved to within this lifetime.  As a concrete example, consider the photon laser pumping mechanism illustrated in \figureref{Introduction:4LevelOpticalLaserModel} and the atom laser pumping mechanism illustrated in \figureref{Introduction:ReservoirChoices}(a).  The fundamental difference between these two pumping mechanisms is that for the photon laser, the emitted photon goes into the lasing mode, while for the atom laser, it is the decayed atom that enters the lasing mode.  The decay process of these pumping mechanisms is illustrated in \figureref{Introduction:AtomDecay}.  If a violation of energy conservation is permitted in this process of up to $\pm \Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is the spontaneous lifetime of the $\ket{e}$ state, excited atoms with a wider range of momenta can contribute gain to the lasing mode in the case of the photon laser than in the case of the atom laser.  Specifically, for the photon laser, the wavenumber of the excited atom in the direction parallel to the lasing mode may vary by
\begin{align*}
    \left(\Delta k_{i,\parallel}\right)_\text{ph} \approx \frac{2 M \Gamma}{\hbar \abs{\vect{k}_\gamma}},
\end{align*}
where $M$ is the mass of the atom.  The wavenumber of the atom in perpendicular directions is unconstrained.  However, for the atom laser, the magnitude of the wavenumber of the excited atom may only vary by (assuming a stationary lasing mode of size $d$)
\begin{align*}
    \left(\Delta \abs{\vect{k}_{i}}\right)_\text{at} \approx \frac{2 \Gamma}{c} + \frac{\pi}{d},
\end{align*}
where the second term is due to the momentum-width of the lasing mode.  For the $\lambda = \unit[633]{nm}$ lasing transition of the Helium-Neon gas laser, $\Gamma = \unit[1.4]{MHz}$ \citep[Table~13.2-1]{SalehTeich}, $M_\text{Ne} = 3.3 \times \unit[10^{-26}]{kg}$, giving $\left(\Delta k_{i,\parallel}\right)_\text{ph} \sim \unit[10^8]{m\textsuperscript{-1}}$ for the photon laser and $\left(\Delta \abs{\vect{k}_{i}}\right)_\text{at} \sim \unit[10^{6}]{m\textsuperscript{-1}}$ for an atom laser with a lasing mode of size $d \sim \unit[10]{\micro m}$.  This difference significantly constrains the possible momentum width of the pumping excitations for the pumping mechanism to operate in the `homogeneously broadened' limit.  If the momentum width of the pumping excitations is greater than this, gain for modes other than the lasing mode will not be saturated by the lasing mode, and these other modes experiencing gain will increase the linewidth of the atom laser.

    }
\end{figure}

In \chapterref{OpticalPumping}, a pumping mechanism for an atom laser using an optical reservoir is considered.  We attempt to solve the problem of the narrow permissible momentum width of the pumping excitations by making their momentum distribution sufficiently narrow that it can be guaranteed that every atom will be momentum-resonant with the pumping process at some point.  In \chapterref{KineticTheory}, a pumping mechanism using atomic modes as the reservoir is considered.  Although their dispersion relation cannot be considered flat with respect to that of the lasing mode atoms, it is far more so than for photons.  The difficulty with this pumping mechanism is that it is inescapable that thermal atoms will be in the vicinity of the lasing mode.  Scattering between the lasing and thermal atoms will contribute to the collisional broadening of the lasing mode.  Using a Feschbach resonance to cancel these interactions is not an option, as the pumping mechanism itself relies upon interatomic collisions.

\section{Matter wave amplification\dots}

A number of matter-wave amplification processes using the two possible reservoirs have been proposed and demonstrated.  These are discussed in this section.  While none of these matter-wave amplification processes constitute an atom laser pumping mechanism, it is envisaged that an atom laser pumping mechanism would be based on a similar process.

\subsection{\dots\ using an optical reservoir}

A number of previous experiments observing the process of super-radiant Rayleigh scattering seem to offer a physical mechanism for providing pumping through matter-wave amplification \citep{Inouye:1999ph,Kozuma:1999pi}.  Super-radiant Rayleigh scattering occurs when a far off-resonant laser illuminates an elongated BEC.  A matter-wave grating forms along the long axis of the BEC and atoms are preferentially scattered into non-stationary momentum states.  By providing a moving `seed', researchers were able to demonstrate pulsed coherent amplification via the Rayleigh super-radiance mechanism.  However, this type of matter-wave amplification is a transient phenomena, observed over timescales ranging from tens \citep{Inouye:1999ph} to hundreds of microseconds \citep{Kozuma:1999pi}.  On longer timescales, scattering into successively higher momentum modes seems unavoidable \citep{Zobay:2006}, resulting in a `fan'-shaped scattering pattern \citep{Inouye:1999yq}.

Two promising mechanisms for providing a pumping mechanism consistent with a continuous atom laser have recently been demonstrated.  The first is far-detuned stimulated Raman scattering \citep{Schneble:2004,Yoshikawa:2004}, in which atoms in one internal atomic state are Bose-stimulated to make transitions into an alternative atomic state.  The second, reported by \citet{Ginsberg:2007fk}, is a resonant coupling driven by electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT), demonstrated as stimulated decay of atom pulses into a condensate in a freely falling frame in the context of quantum information processing.  In both cases, the coupling from the source mode is irreversible and the laser mode is dark to the photons produced by the stimulated transitions.

In \chapterref{OpticalPumping}, we consider a pumping mechanism for an atom laser derived from the Raman superradiance and EIT matter-wave amplification processes.  A discussion of related theoretical proposals is given in that chapter.

% \subsubsection{Theoretical proposals}
% 
% There have been several theoretical proposals for atom laser pumping mechanisms that use optical reservoirs.  Several of these\footnote{FIXME: Missing citations.} operate in the Lamb-Dicke limit in which the lasing mode is significantly smaller than the wavelength of the photons they emit.  This is a difficult regime to reach, and it requires the use of a Feschbach resonance to make interatomic interactions negligible if the lasing mode is to be operated with even relatively modest lasing mode occupations $N_0 \gtrsim 10^2$ \citep{Cirac:1994}.  This is an experimental difficulty, but not an insurmountable one.  There are other difficulties with these proposals that are more fatal.
% 
% \citet{Spreeuw:1995} propose trapping atoms in a repulsive optical lattice.  Loss due to off-resonant scattering from the optical trapping beams is greater for the higher-energy states of each lattice site as these states penetrate the repulsive trapping potential more than the lower-energy states.  This gives this proposal the favourable property that loss from higher-energy states is greater than that for lower-energy states, a property difficult to achieve in some circumstances (see \sectionref{Introduction:ThePumpingMechanism}).  However, this proposed pumping mechanism requires that the characteristic energy of the thermal source atoms $k_B T \lesssim \hbar \omega$, where $\omega$ is the trapping frequency of the lattice sites.  As this is also the energy separation between the trapped levels, this must be significantly less than the trap depth, thus requiring that the thermal clouds be isolated to each lattice site.  Each lattice site would therefore operate as independent atom lasers with random relative phases.  The outcoupled mode from this system would therefore not have the coherence properties desired of an atom laser.
% 
% \citep{Cirac:1994} consider a closed system, and optical cooling of a thermal cloud in a system in the LDL.  
% 
% 
% The desire in the LDL is to optically cool to form an atom laser
% 
% \citep{Cirac:1994} is another model in the LDL, which is based upon coherent pumping, and spontaneous decay.  It is also necessary that the degeneracy of the levels is lifted such that reabsorption is not a problem.  This requires that $\Gamma \ll \omega_\text{trap}$, which is a significant requirement.

\subsection{\dots\ using an atomic reservoir}

The production of BEC using the standard technique of evaporation \citep{Hess:1986,Ketterle:1996} is a matter-wave amplification process \citep{Luiten:1996,Gardiner:1997uq,Miesner:1998}.  In this process, atoms with energy greater than a threshold are removed from the system, thus reducing the mean energy of the system.  Elastic collisions between the remaining atoms lead to rethermalisation at a lower temperature.  This process has been experimentally demonstrated to give exponential gain of the condensate mode until the thermal cloud becomes significantly depleted \citep{Miesner:1998}.

Four-wave mixing of matter-waves \citep{Deng:1999qy} is a fundamentally similar process in which two atoms undergo a collision and scatter into different momentum modes.  When one of the final momentum modes is already occupied, this process is Bose-enhanced, and is a matter-wave amplification process \citep{Vogels:2002}.  If neither of the final momentum modes are occupied, the scattering process gives rise to entanglement between the atoms in the final momentum modes, although only classical correlations have been observed to date \citep{Perrin:2007}.

In \chapterref{KineticTheory}, we consider a pumping mechanism for an atom laser based on evaporation.  In particular, we consider the temperature and flux requirements of the atomic source that must be used to replenish the thermal cloud.


% Theory of an atom laser \citep{Holland:1996mz} --- Single mode, effective Homogeneous broadening, it works, evaporative pumping
% An atom laser based on evaporative cooling \citep{Wiseman:1996} --- Single mode, effective Homogeneous broadening, it work, evaporative pumping
% Theory of a coherent atomic-beam generator \citep{Guzman:1996} ---  Atoms trapped in an optical lattice, interacting via the dipole-dipole interaction.  This dipole-dipole interaction is mediated by the optical lattice.  The dipoles are in fact formed by the optical lattice.  Absent the ac Stark shift, the dipole-dipole interaction would be negligible.  The dipole-dipole interaction therefore occurs whenever \emph{detuned} radiation is present.  In the presence of resonant light, it may be that other effects dominate.  Their simulations are effectively single mode, effective Homogeneous broadening, dipole--dipole interaction with evaporative pumping
% Reducing the Linewidth of an Atom Laser by Feedback \citep{Wiseman:2001zr} --- Single mode model, but demonstrates that some of the linewidth issues can be resolved by feedback
% More feedback reducing the linewidth \citep{Thomsen:2002xc}.
