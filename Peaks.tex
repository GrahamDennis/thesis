\section{Introduction}
Sources of matter waves gained a dramatic improvement with the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in dilute gases and the development of the atom laser \citep{Anderson:1995vn,Mewes:1997}. Like optical lasers before them, atom lasers can produce Heisenberg-limited beam profiles \citep{Busch:2002zr,Riou:2006uq} and promise high spectral density through their dramatically lower linewidth \citep{Wiseman:1997ba}. Another exciting possibility resulting from having such a coherent source of atoms is the generation of nonclassical matter waves through entangled beams. Such entangled beams are useful for tests of quantum mechanics and are required to perform Heisenberg-limited interferometry \citep{Dowling:1998,Reid:1988}. In this chapter, we show that the asymmetric scattering lengths between internal states of metastable helium (He*) cause well-defined peaks in the output of an atom laser. These peaks are due to a phase-matched four-wave mixing (FWM) process and are experimentally demonstrated.

A nonlinear process is required to produce entanglement, and one of the advantages of atomic systems over optical systems is that there are strong inherent nonlinearities due to atomic interactions, although these interactions can also lead to complications. These nonlinearities allow certain analogues of nonlinear optical experiments such as four-wave mixing (FWM) and Kerr squeezing to be performed directly in the atomic sample \citep{WallsMilburn}. All of these produce entanglement in optical systems. Four-wave mixing in a trapped BEC has been demonstrated experimentally in configurations where three distinct momentum states generated a fourth \citep{Deng:1999qy} and where two momentum states generated a pair of correlated atomic beams \citep{Vogels:2002}. These experiments demonstrated that the output phase was coherent, but the correlation properties were not measured. More recently the pair correlations in a spontaneous scattering of two colliding condensates were measured using the single-atom detectors available for He* atoms \citep{Perrin:2007}.

Using these existing sources of entangled pairs of atoms for interferometric experiments will be complicated by the high densities of the sources, where the nonlinearities that generated the correlations ultimately degrade the long-term coherence of the sample. While recent experiments have increased the coherence of atom interferometers by several orders of magnitude by reducing the nonlinearities with a Feschbach resonance \citep{Fattori:2008,Gustavsson:2008}, this precludes the production of entangled pairs. In our scheme the nonlinear interactions are used to drive FWM in the magnetically untrapped condensate, but the resulting untrapped beams that propagate in free space are dilute, potentially avoiding the decoherence problem. We show that pairs of beams can be produced simply by the process of radio-frequency (rf) outcoupling from a He* BEC, without the need for Feschbach resonances, optical traps, or scattering pulses. Unlike previous methods, which required pairs of atoms travelling at high kinetic energies as a source, this process involves scattering between atoms initially in the same zero-momentum state to create states with nonzero momentum. Semiclassical and field-theoretic simulations of the experiment show that the beams are generated by the same FWM process that generated entangled atom pairs in the earlier experiments.

\section{The metastable Helium `Peaks' experiment}
\label{Peaks:ExperimentalSetup}

The experimental setup for creating He* BEC has been reported elsewhere \citep{Dall:2007a}, and discussed earlier in this thesis (see \sectionref{He*Experiment}\footnote{FIXME: Correct this reference when this section is written}). The experiment discussed in this section was performed by \emph{Robert Dall}, \emph{Lesa Byron} and \emph{Andrew Truscott} at the Research School of Physics and Engineering, ANU.

Starting from an almost pure BEC containing up to $5\times 10^6$ atoms an atom laser beam was created by using rf photons to spin flip the BEC atoms from the $m=1$ magnetically trapped state to the $m=0$ untrapped state.

After outcoupling, atoms in the atom laser beam fell under gravity for a distance of $\unit[4]{cm}$ until they hit a double stacked multichannel plate (MCP). The phosphor screen was imaged with a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera with a resolution of approximately $\unit[150]{\micro m}$ at the MCP. To remove any nonuniformities caused by spatial variations in the gain of the MCP, all images were divided by a flat-field image produced by dropping atoms from a MOT onto the detector. Since the MOT temperature is of order $\sim\unit[1]{mK}$, the spatial profile of the MOT uniformly illuminates the MCP. Although $m=-1$ atoms are produced by the outcoupling, especially for high rf powers, they are in general accelerated away from the detector by the magnetic trap field. Those that are accelerated towards the detector do not show up in the images since they arrive much earlier than the CCD trigger time.

\figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults} shows the dramatic change in the atom laser spatial profile when the condensate undergoes the resonant FWM process. In the case of low outcoupling Rabi frequencies (upper row), the FWM process does not occur and we see the usual double-peaked He*-atom laser profile \citep{Dall:2007} (see also \sectionref{TransverseProfile:Helium}\footnote{FIXME: Correct this reference when this section is written}). When the Rabi frequencies are high enough to initiate the FWM process (lower row), the atoms in the atom laser beam are scattered to form a halo around the main atom laser beam. Due to conservation of energy, the outer diameter of this halo corresponds to a maximum kinetic energy given by the chemical potential. As well as the ring structure, four peaks are observed on the outskirts of the profile.
% Each peak contains 11\%--14\% of the total outcoupled atoms, in agreement with the value of 11\% obtained from the simulation results shown in the lower row of \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}.

These peaks arise from two momentum-correlated cones of particles scattering out of the condensate and falling to the detector, as shown in \figureref{Peaks:Schematic}. The cones themselves are generated by a dynamical instability that populates momentum modes lying along the weak trapping axis, which expand to rings due to the mean-field repulsion in the tight trapping direction as they leave the BEC. Atoms in these cones then fall under gravity onto the detector, where the time-integrated flux is converted to a spatial density distribution, and each momentum ring appears as a double peak. The background halo is produced during the initial switch-on of the atom laser during which the peaks produced by the FWM process sweep in position from the main atom laser profile towards their final position in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}.

\section{Condensate excitations in the perturbative regime}
\label{Peaks:PerturbativeApproach}
%While the argument in the previous section gives a qualitative explanation for the four-wave mixing process observed in He*, it is not entirely satisfying. In this section an approximate analytic expression for the excited modes of the He* system will be obtained and investigated using Bogoliubov stuff.

The observed features in the atom laser profile presented in the previous section are caused by a dynamical instability in the condensate that causes the formation of momentum excitations in a narrow range of momenta along the weak trapping axis. During outcoupling these excitations are accelerated along the tight trapping directions forming the momentum cones pictured in \figureref{Peaks:Schematic}. The detection process vertically integrates this momentum profile leading to the observed peaks in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}.
% The background halo between these peaks and the usual atom laser profile is the result of (at higher detunings resonant momentum will vary across surfaces, during this initial switch-on phase, a range of momenta are excited)\footnote{FIXME: Complete and correct this sentence.}.

The dynamical instability is due to the significantly different scattering lengths between the Zeeman levels of He*. In a later section a full multimode quantum-field calculation will be discussed and its results presented, but it is enlightening to first consider a simplified model in which the energy spectrum (and stability) of small excitations to the condensate can be obtained.

The simplified model to be considered is that of a homogenous spinor condensate consisting of two levels with Rabi oscillations coupling the two levels. The approximation that the condensate is homogenous (known as the local density approximation \cite{Stamper-Kurn:1999,Zambelli:2000}) is justified if the excitations under considerations have wavelengths much smaller than the Thomas-Fermi radius in that dimension. The local density approximation will hold for this system along the axial direction as the axial momentum of the features observed in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults} corresponds to an excitation wavelength of $\sim \unit[5]{\micro m}$, significantly smaller than the Thomas-Fermi radius in the axial direction of $z_\text{TF} = \unit[175]{\micro m}$. 

The second approximation made in this model is to neglect the antitrapped state $m_F=-1$. Any density in this state leaves the condensate very rapidly due to the combined effects of both the mean-field repulsion and the magnetic field gradient. A classical particle in the centre of the condensate under the influence of the same effective potential experienced by the $m_F=-1$ atoms would reach a momentum equal to the momentum width of the condensate (and hence no longer be able to couple to the stationary atoms in the middle of the condensate) in $\sim\unit[80]{\micro s}$, significantly shorter than the inverse Rabi frequency of $\sim \unit[300]{\micro s}$.

With these approximations made, the Hamiltonian for this system is
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:InitialHamiltonian}
    \begin{split}
    \hat{H} &= \sum_i \int d\bm{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \left(\frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2 M} - \mu\right)\hat{\Psi}_i^{\phantom{\dagger}} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i j} U_{i j}\int d\bm{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_j^{\phantom{\dagger}} \hat{\Psi}_i^{\phantom{\dagger}}\\
            &\phantom{=} + \hbar \Omega \int d\bm{x}\, \left(\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_0^{\phantom{\dagger}} + \hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_1^{\phantom{\dagger}}\right),
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where $U_{ij} = 4\pi \hbar^2 a_{ij}/M$ is the nonlinear interaction strength, $a_{ij}$ is the s-wave scattering length between internal states $i$ and $j$, $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency which is taken to be real, and $\mu$ is an energy offset which has been included to cancel the global phase rotation which would otherwise be present. The equations of motion corresponding to this Hamiltonian are
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:OperatorEquationsOfMotion}
    \begin{align}
    i \hbar \frac{\partial \hat{\Psi}_1}{\partial t}  &= -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla^2 \hat{\Psi}_1  + U \left(\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_1^{\phantom{\dagger}} + \hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_0^{\phantom{\dagger}}\right) \hat{\Psi}_1 + \hbar \Omega \hat{\Psi}_0 - \mu \hat{\Psi}_1,  \\
    i \hbar \frac{\partial \hat{\Psi}_0}{\partial t} &= -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M} \nabla^2 \hat{\Psi}_0 + U \left(\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_1^{\phantom{\dagger}} + \kappa \hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger \hat{\Psi}_0^{\phantom{\dagger}} \right) \hat{\Psi}_0 + \hbar \Omega \hat{\Psi}_1 - \mu \hat{\Psi}_0,
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $U=U_{11}=U_{10}$ and $\kappa = U_{00}/U_{11}$. For metastable Helium in the $F=1$ manifold, $\protect{\kappa \approx 0.74}$\footnote{FIXME: Cite something.}, while for Rubidium in the $F=1$ manifold, $\kappa \approx 1.01$ \cite{Ho:1998}\footnote{FIXME: A more recent reference might be useful.}. 

\subsection{The dynamical steady-state}
\label{Peaks:MeanFieldPeriodicity}

The excitation spectrum of a condensate can be obtained by approximating each field operator to be a c-number (the mean-field) plus a small fluctuation term, and then either diagonalising the Hamiltonian \cite{Bogoliubov:1947,FetterWalecka} or diagonalising the linearised equations of motion for the fluctuations themselves (see, for example \cite{Ho:1998}\footnote{FIXME: Probably need an earlier and/or better reference here.}). It is the latter approach that will be taken here, but with the difference that the mean-field about which the linearisation procedure will take place is itself time-dependent.

The mean-field state that we wish to consider is one that corresponds to the state of the BEC in the experiment. At $t=0$ all of the population in this state will be in the $m_F=1$ level, representing the original trapped BEC, while the $m_F=0$ atom laser level will be initially unpopulated. Rabi oscillations will transfer population between these two levels, and it will be shown that these oscillations are periodic.

The method for diagonalising the evolution equations of the linearised fluctuations to obtain the excitation spectrum is the same method used to determine the stability of fixed points of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. This method relies critically on the fact that it is a \emph{fixed} point about which the equations are linearised. Floquet's Theorem \citep{Nayfeh:1995} allows the stability of \emph{periodic} solutions to be considered, and it is this theorem that will be used to determine the stability of the mean-field evolution. It will now be shown that this mean-field evolution is periodic.

Within the local density approximation we can assume that the mean-field remains homogeneous; only the excitations will have spatial dependence. The equations of motion for the mean-field then reduce to the following ordinary differential equations,
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion}
    \begin{align}
    i \hbar \frac{d \Psi_1}{dt} &= U\left(\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2\right)\Psi_1 + \hbar \Omega \Psi_0 - \mu \Psi_1,\\
    i \hbar \frac{d \Psi_0}{dt} &= U\left(\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2\right)\Psi_0 + \hbar \Omega \Psi_1 - \mu \Psi_0.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Although solving \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion} for $\kappa \neq 1$ is intractable analytically, it can at least be shown that the solutions are periodic. This can be shown by recognising these equations as modified optical Bloch equations containing a nonlinear term but with no damping. Defining $\Psi_i = c_i\sqrt{n}$ where $n = \abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2$ is the total density, the equations of motion for the density matrix terms $\rho_{10} = c_{1}^{}c_{0}^*$ and $w = \rho_{11}-\rho_{00} = \abs{c_1}^2 - \abs{c_0}^2$ are
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:OpticalBlochEquations}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{d\rho_{10}}{dt} &= -i\frac{g}{2} (1-w)\rho_{10} + i \Omega w,\\
        \frac{d w}{dt} &= -4 \Omega \Im\{\rho_{10}\},
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $g = n U (1-\kappa)/\hbar$. As the evolution is purely Hamiltonian, these equations will conserve the energy of the state. Up to an arbitrary additive constant, the energy per particle is given by
\begin{align}
    E &= -\frac{1}{8}\hbar g(1 - w)^2 + 2 \hbar \Omega \Re\{\rho_{10}\}.
    \label{Peaks:OpticalBlochEnergy}
\end{align}
The solutions to \eqref{Peaks:OpticalBlochEquations} are visualised in \figureref{Peaks:BlochSphere}.

As the evolution is purely Hamiltonian, the state can be described by a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere (see \figureref{Peaks:BlochSphere}).  The state is however not completely free to move on this sphere as the Hamiltonian must be conserved by its motion. This further restricts the system's motion to closed lines on the surface of the Bloch sphere, therefore requiring the system's motion to be periodic. Although this demonstrates that all physical expectation values are periodic, for the wavefunctions themselves to be periodic, the global phase rotation must be cancelled. This can be achieved by appropriate choice of the energy offset $\mu$. It is the periodicity of the wavefunctions $\Psi_i$ that will enable the stability of the condensate to excitations to be determined.

\subsection{Excitation dynamics}

The evolution of small perturbations about the mean-field dynamics of a condensate define both the excitation spectrum of the condensate and its stability to perturbations. 
%These perturbations not only arise from experimental uncertainties, but are an  inescapable consequence of quantum mechanics due to the fluctuations of the vacuum itself.
To determine the evolution of these excitations the mean-field dynamics must be separated from that of the excitations. To this aim we define the deviation operators $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i = \hat{\Psi}_i - \mean{\hat{\Psi}_i}$ and treat $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i$ as a small quantity. In this case the $\mean{\hat{\Psi}_i}=\Psi_i$ are themselves time dependent, obeying the equations for the mean-field, \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion}.

The equations of motion for the deviation operators are obtained by replacing the field operators $\hat{\Psi}_i$ in the operator evolution equations \eqref{Peaks:OperatorEquationsOfMotion} with $\Psi_i + \delta \hat{\Psi}_i$ and keeping only terms up to first order in the deviation operators. Applying this procedure gives
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsEvolutionXSpace}
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            i \hbar \frac{\partial \delta \hat{\Psi}_1}{\partial t} =& U\left[ \left(2\abs{\Psi_1}^2+\abs{\Psi_0}^2 \right)\delta \hat{\Psi}_1 + \Psi_1^2\delta\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger + \Psi_1\Psi_0\delta\hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger + \Psi_0^*\Psi_1\delta\hat{\Psi}_0\right]\\
                    & - \frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla^2 \delta \hat{\Psi}_1 +\hbar \Omega\delta\hat{\Psi}_0- \mu \delta \hat{\Psi}_1,
        \end{split}\\
        \begin{split}
        i \hbar \frac{\partial \delta \hat{\Psi}_0}{\partial t} =& U\left[\left(2\kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2 +\abs{\Psi_1}^2\right)\delta\hat{\Psi}_0 + \kappa \Psi_0^2 \delta\hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger + \Psi_1\Psi_0\delta\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger + \Psi_1^*\Psi_0\delta\hat{\Psi}_1\right]\\
                    & -\frac{\hbar^2}{2M}\nabla^2 \delta \hat{\Psi}_0 +\hbar \Omega\delta\hat{\Psi}_1 - \mu \delta\hat{\Psi}_0.
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

Having assumed the condensate to be homogenous, the system is translation-invariant and the evolution equations will take their simplest form in a Fourier basis. Performing the Fourier transform of \eqref{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsEvolutionXSpace} yields
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsEvolutionKSpace}
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            i \hbar \frac{\partial \delta \hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k})}{\partial t} =& U\left[ \left(2\abs{\Psi_1}^2+\abs{\Psi_0}^2 \right)\delta \hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k}) + \Psi_1^2\delta\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger(-\bm{k}) + \Psi_1\Psi_0\delta\hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger(-\bm{k}) + \Psi_0^*\Psi_1\delta\hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k})\right]\\
                    & +\frac{\hbar^2 \bm{k}^2}{2M} \delta \hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k}) +\hbar \Omega\delta\hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k})- \mu \delta \hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k}),
        \end{split}\\
        \begin{split}
        i \hbar \frac{\partial \delta \hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k})}{\partial t} =& U\left[\left(2\kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2 +\abs{\Psi_1}^2\right)\delta\hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k}) + \kappa \Psi_0^2 \delta\hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger(-\bm{k}) + \Psi_1\Psi_0\delta\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger(-\bm{k}) + \Psi_1^*\Psi_0\delta\hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k})\right]\\
                    & +\frac{\hbar^2 \bm{k}^2}{2M} \delta \hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k}) +\hbar \Omega\delta\hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k}) - \mu \delta\hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k}).
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

In this form, it is clear that the Fourier modes are almost completely decoupled from each other. Each deviation operator $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i(\bm{k})$ is only coupled to $\left\{\delta\hat{\Psi}_j(\bm{k}),\, \delta\hat{\Psi}_j^\dagger(-\bm{k})\right\}$, with each $\delta\hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger(-\bm{k})$ also only coupled to this same set. This can be exploited to write the equations \eqref{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsEvolutionKSpace} in matrix form as
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsMatrixEvolution}
    i \hbar \frac{\partial \hat{\bm{\Upsilon}}(\bm{k})}{\partial t} &= \mathcal{H}(\bm{k}) \hat{\bm{\Upsilon}}(\bm{k}),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    \hat{\bm{\Upsilon}}(\bm{k}) &= 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \delta\hat{\Psi}_1(\bm{k}) &
        \delta\hat{\Psi}_1^\dagger(-\bm{k}) &
        \delta\hat{\Psi}_0(\bm{k}) &
        \delta\hat{\Psi}_0^\dagger(-\bm{k})
    \end{pmatrix}^\text{T},\\
    \mathcal{H}(\bm{k}) &= 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \varepsilon(\bm{k}) + q_{1} - \mu & v_{11} & u_{01} + \hbar \Omega & v_{10}\\
        -v_{11}^* & -\varepsilon(\bm{k}) - q_1 + \mu & -v_{10}^* & -u_{10} - \hbar \Omega\\
        u_{10} + \hbar \Omega & v_{10} & \varepsilon(\bm{k}) + q_0 - \mu & \kappa v_{00}\\
        -v_{10}^* & -u_{01} - \hbar \Omega & -\kappa v_{00}^* & -\varepsilon(\bm{k}) - q_0 + \mu
    \end{pmatrix},\label{Peaks:HMatrix}
\end{align}
and $q_1 = U\left(2\abs{\Psi_1}^2+\abs{\Psi_0}^2\right)$, $q_0 = U\left(2\kappa \abs{\Psi_0}^2 + \abs{\Psi_1}^2\right)$, $u_{ij} = U\Psi_i^*\Psi_j$, $v_{ij} = U\Psi_i\Psi_j$, and $\displaystyle \protect{\varepsilon(\bm{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2 \bm{k}^2}{2M}}$.

If the coefficients of the matrix $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ were not time-dependent, the excitation spectrum of the condensate could simply be obtained from the real parts of the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$. Non-zero imaginary components for these eigenvalues would indicate the corresponding mode to be unstable\footnote{FIXME: Do these statements need more detail? Including it would detract from overall flow though.}. Before continuing with the general case of $\kappa \neq 1$, in the next section the limit in which all scattering lengths are equal ($\kappa=1$) will be considered and some familiar results recovered.

\subsection{Excitation spectra in the $\kappa = 1$ limit}
\label{Peaks:Kappa1Limit}
In the limit that all the scattering lengths are the same ($\kappa = 1$), the nonlinear term in \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion} only contributes to a rotation of the global phase of the spinor condensate. In this case the dynamics can be solved analytically and familiar excitation spectra recovered.

The general solution to \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion} for $\kappa = 1$ is
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:Kappa1MeanFieldSolution}
    \begin{align}
        \Psi_1(t) &= \cos(\Omega t) \Phi_+ + \sin(\Omega t) \Phi_-, \\
        \Psi_0(t) &= -i\sin(\Omega t) \Phi_+ + i\cos(\Omega t) \Phi_-,
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
for some complex constants $\Phi_\pm$, and where the chemical potential $\mu = n U$ has cancelled the global phase rotation. This solution can be viewed as a linear basis transformation from $\Psi_i$ to $\Phi_\pm$. Performing this change of basis for both the $\Psi_i$ and $\delta \hat{\Psi}_i$ yields a matrix of precisely the same form as in \eqref{Peaks:HMatrix} but in terms of $\Phi_\pm$ instead of the $\Psi_i$, and with $\Omega \rightarrow 0$. This new matrix $\mathcal{H}'(\bm{k})$ is now time-independent and can be diagonalised to give the eigenvalues
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:Kappa1Eigenvalues}
    \begin{align}
        \hbar \omega_\uparrow(\bm{k}) &= \sqrt{\varepsilon(\bm{k})\left(\varepsilon(\bm{k}) + 2 n U\right)},\\
        \hbar \omega_\downarrow(\bm{k}) &= \varepsilon(\bm{k}),
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\displaystyle\varepsilon(\bm{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2\bm{k}^2}{2M}$, $n= \abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2$ and the remaining two eigenvalues are the negatives of \eqref{Peaks:Kappa1Eigenvalues}. $\hbar \omega_\uparrow(\bm{k})$ is the usual Bogoliubov spectrum \citep{Bogoliubov:1947} corresponding to excitations in the total condensate density. The eigenvalue $\hbar \omega_\downarrow(\bm{k})$ is the free particle spectrum; this excitation only changes the relative densities of the two states without affecting the total density, hence not affecting the nonlinear term in the Hamiltonian \eqref{Peaks:InitialHamiltonian}.

The Hamiltonian for the condensate excitations that corresponds to the eigenvalues \eqref{Peaks:Kappa1Eigenvalues} is
\begin{align}
    \hat{H} &= \sum_{i=\uparrow,\downarrow}\int d\bm{k}\, \hbar \omega_i(\bm{k}) \hat{\Lambda}_i^\dagger(\bm{k}) \hat{\Lambda}_i^{\phantom{\dagger}}(\bm{k}),
\end{align}
where the $\hat{\Lambda}_{\uparrow,\downarrow}(\bm{k})$ obey boson commutation relations and are the corresponding normalised eigenvectors to the eigenvalues in \eqref{Peaks:Kappa1Eigenvalues}. The normalised eigenvectors for the negatives of those eigenvalues are the $\hat{\Lambda}_{\uparrow, \downarrow}^\dagger(-\bm{k})$.

\subsection[Floquet's theorem]{Floquet's theorem \citep{Nayfeh:1995}}
\label{Peaks:FloquetsTheorem}

Having considered the limit of equal scattering lengths, it now remains to determine the energy spectrum and condensate stability in the general case of $\kappa \neq 1$. Analytic results cannot be obtained in this limit, but numeric results corresponding to the experimental situation in \sectionref{Peaks:ExperimentalSetup} can be obtained.

In the general case, the excitation spectrum cannot be obtained from the eigenvalues of the matrix $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ in \eqref{Peaks:HMatrix} as the matrix's entries are  themselves time-dependent. However, due to the periodicity of the mean-field wavefunctions demonstrated in \sectionref{Peaks:MeanFieldPeriodicity}, the entries of $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ are themselves periodic, which enables Floquet's theorem to be applied.

Floquet's theorem proves that the matrix solution to the initial-value problem
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:FloquetMatrixIVP}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{d\bm{\Pi}(t)}{dt} &= \bm{A}(t) \bm{\Pi}(t),\\
        \bm{\Pi}(0) &= \mathbb{I},
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathbb{I}$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix and $\bm{A}(t)$ a periodic $n \times n$ matrix with period $T$ can be written in the form
\begin{align}
    \bm{\Pi}(t) = \bm{P}(t) \exp(\bm{Q} t),
\end{align}
for some constant matrix $\bm{Q}$ and $\bm{P}(t)$ a matrix function with period $T$ and $\bm{P}(0) = \mathbb{I}$. The matrix solution $\bm{\Pi}(t)$ is the general solution to the related linear system
\begin{align}
    \frac{d\bm{x}(t)}{dt} &= \bm{A}(t) \bm{x}(t),
    \label{Peaks:FloquetVectorIVP}
\end{align}
for any initial condition $\bm{x}(0)$ where $\bm{x}(t)$ is a vector. Every solution $\bm{x}(t)$ to this problem can be written in terms of the matrix $\bm{\Pi}(t)$ as
\begin{align}
    \bm{x}(t) &= \bm{\Pi}(t) \bm{x}(0),
\end{align}
as is easily verified. The matrix solution $\bm{\Pi}(t)$ thus completely determines the behaviour of all solutions to \eqref{Peaks:FloquetVectorIVP}.

The eigenvalues of $\bm{Q}$ are known as \emph{Floquet exponents} (or \emph{characteristic exponents}) and determine the long-term growth or decay of the solutions to \eqref{Peaks:FloquetVectorIVP}. These eigenvalues can be obtained from the \emph{monodromy matrix},
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:MonodromyMatrix}
    \mathcal{M} &= \bm{\Pi}(T) = \exp(\bm{Q} T),
\end{align}
as $\bm{P}(T) = \bm{P}(0) = \mathbb{I}$. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to \eqref{Peaks:FloquetMatrixIVP} guarantees that $\bm{\Pi}(t)$ and hence $\mathcal{M}$ will be invertible. The Floquet exponents $\xi_i$ can therefore be obtained from the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of the monodromy matrix using $\lambda_i = \exp(\xi_i T)$. It is the Floquet exponents of the matrix $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ that we wish to calculate in order to determine the stability of the condensate to excitations.

\subsection{Determination of the dynamical instabilities}
\label{Peaks:ExperimentEigenvalues}

The method outlined in the previous section for determining the Floquet exponents of the matrix $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ requires knowledge of its period $T$, and hence the period of the mean field dynamics given by \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion}. Although this period cannot be determined analytically, it can be found numerically.

It was shown in \sectionref{Peaks:MeanFieldPeriodicity} that up to a global phase rotation, the mean fields $\Psi_j(t)$ are periodic. The mean fields $\Psi_j(t)$ can be therefore written in the form
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierDecomposition}
    \Psi_j(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \alpha_{j,n} \exp\left[i 2\pi \left( n \nu_0 + \Delta\nu\right)t \right],
\end{align}
for some complex constants $\alpha_{j, n}$, fundamental frequency $\nu_0 = T^{-1}$, and frequency offset $\Delta \nu$. In this form, the $\Psi_j(t)$ are not exactly periodic as $\Psi_j(T) = \exp(i\Delta \nu T)\Psi_j(0)$, but this frequency offset can be cancelled by an appropriate choice of the energy offset $\mu$ in \eqref{Peaks:InitialHamiltonian}.

The period $T$ and frequency offset $\Delta\nu$ in \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierDecomposition} can be determined from the Fourier transform of $\Psi_j(t)$ which will have sharp peaks at the frequencies $n \nu_0 + \Delta \nu$ (see \figureref{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierTransform}). Choosing the energy offset $\mu=-h \nu$, the frequency offset in \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierDecomposition} can be cancelled making the $\Psi_j(t)$ with this energy offset exactly periodic with period $T$. \figureref{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierTransform} illustrates the Fourier transform of the numerical solutions for $\Psi_j(t)$ from which the period $T=\unit[150]{\micro{}s}$ and frequency offset $\Delta \nu = \unit[-1.78]{kHz}$ have been obtained.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=14cm]{MeanFieldFourierTransform}
    \caption{\label{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierTransform} Temporal Fourier transform of the calculated mean field evolution defined by \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion} for the centre of the condensate defined by the experimental parameters given in \tableref{Peaks:ExperimentalParameters}. The frequency $\nu_0$ is the inverse period of the system, and $\Delta\nu$ represents the global phase rotation. From the data in this figure the values $\nu_0 = \unit[6.65]{kHz}$ and $\Delta\nu = \unit[-1.78]{kHz}$ can be determined, giving the period as $T=\unit[150]{\micro{}s}$.}
\end{figure}

The period and energy offset determined, it remains to calculate the mono\-dromy matrix $\mathcal{M}(\bm{k})$ from which the Floquet exponents may be derived. This is achieved by numerically solving the related matrix problem to \eqref{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsMatrixEvolution} from $t=0$ to $t=T$ [refer to \eqref{Peaks:MonodromyMatrix}]. Noting that the matrix $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ only depends on $k = \abs{\bm{k}}$, the solutions for the Floquet exponents $\xi_i(\bm{k}) = \gamma_i(\bm{k}) + i\omega(\bm{k})$ are illustrated in \figureref{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=19cm]{CondensateEigenvalues}
    \caption{\label{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}
        Illustration of the Floquet exponents for $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$ and comparison to a corresponding truncated Wigner simulation.
        Upper figure (a) displays the imaginary part $\omega_i$ of the Floquet exponents. As the $\omega_i$ can only be determined up to a multiple of $2\pi\nu_0$ [see \eqref{Peaks:AmbiguityFloquetExponent}], they have been reduced modulo $2\pi\nu_0$ into the range $\left[-\pi\nu_0,\, \pi\nu_0\right]$.
        The middle figure (b) shows the real part $\gamma_i$ of the Floquet exponents, which indicate an instability for the corresponding wavenumber when they are nonzero.
        Lower figure (c) shows the results of a 1D truncated Wigner simulation corresponding to the system under consideration in (a) and (b). The truncated Wigner simulation exhibits growth in the same modes predicted from the results of the perturbative analysis shown in (b). The truncated Wigner results shown are the average of 500 paths.}
\end{figure}

The temporal periodicity of the system implies that the imaginary components $\omega_i(\bm{k})$ of the Floquet exponents are only uniquely defined modulo $2\pi \nu_0$ (see \figureref{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}(a)). This is because any eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the monodromy matrix $\mathcal{M}(\bm{k})$ corresponds to infinitely many Floquet exponents,
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:AmbiguityFloquetExponent}
    \lambda = \exp\left[\left(\gamma + i\omega + i 2 \pi n \nu_0\right)T\right] = \exp\left[\left(\gamma + i \omega\right)T\right].
\end{align}
This does not hinder our understanding of the system as our primary interest is in the stability of the condensate to excitations, which is determined by the $\gamma_i(\bm{k})$.

The normalised eigenvectors of the system are not always annihilation or creation operators; as is discussed in \appendixref{FloquetAppendix}, this is only true when the Floquet exponents are pure imaginary. When the Floquet exponents have a nonzero real component, annihilation and creation operators can be constructed from linear combinations of the eigenvectors. Not being eigenvectors, these operators will therefore have nontrivial evolution. As is shown in \appendixref{FloquetAppendix}, Floquet exponents with nonzero real parts come in pairs of the form $\pm \gamma(\bm{k}) + i \omega(\bm{k})$. From the corresponding eigenvectors to these Floquet exponents the bosonic annihilation operator $\hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k}, t)$ can be formed, which evolves as
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:DynamicalInstability}
    \begin{align}
        \hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k}, nT) &= e^{i n\omega(\bm{k}) T} \left( \sinh(n\gamma(\bm{k}) T) \hat{\Lambda}'^\dagger(-\bm{k}, 0) + \cosh(n\gamma(\bm{k}) T) \hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k}, 0)\right),\\
        \hat{\Lambda}'(\bm{k}, nT) &= e^{-i n \omega(\bm{k}) T} \left( \sinh(n\gamma(\bm{k}) T) \hat{\Lambda}^\dagger(-\bm{k}, 0) + \cosh(n\gamma(\bm{k}) T) \hat{\Lambda}'(\bm{k}, 0)\right),
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $n$ is a positive integer, and where $\hat{\Lambda}'(\bm{k}, t)$ will be equal to $\hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k}, t)$ in some circumstances as discussed in \appendixref{FloquetAppendix}. Due to the exponential growth in \eqref{Peaks:DynamicalInstability}, the mode corresponding to $\hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k})$ represents a dynamical instability of the condensate.

The behaviour of the dynamical instabilities will be governed by \eqref{Peaks:DynamicalInstability} only while the unstable modes have a small occupation compared to the condensate, and scattering between the unstable modes can be neglected. \figureref{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}(c) shows the results of a truncated Wigner simulation of the Hamiltonian \eqref{Peaks:InitialHamiltonian}, which is in excellent agreement with the location of the dynamical instabilities as determined by the Floquet exponents [see \figureref{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}(b)]. For later times, there is an additional mode undergoing growth, $k \approx \unit[7.5\times 10^5]{m}^{-1}$. This mode is the result of scattering between the dynamical instabilities, a process neglected the perturbative approach taken in this section. 

\parasep

In summary, the procedure used to find the Floquet exponents of $\mathcal{H}(\bm{k})$, and hence the stability of the condensate to excitations is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Numerically solve \eqref{Peaks:MeanFieldEquationsOfMotion} with $\mu=0$ for a long period of time $t \gg T$ where $T$ is the periodicity of the solution.
    \item Perform the temporal Fourier transform of the solutions obtained for $\Psi_i(t)$ to accurately determine the period $T$ and the value of the energy offset $\mu$ required to cancel any global phase evolution to make the wavefunctions themselves periodic (see \figureref{Peaks:MeanFieldFourierTransform}).
    \item Using the calculated period and energy offset, numerically solve the related matrix problem to \eqref{Peaks:DeviationOperatorsMatrixEvolution} for a range of values of $\bm{k}$ to obtain the monodromy matrix $\mathcal{M}(\bm{k})$.
    \item Calculate the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $\mathcal{M}(\bm{k})$ and determine the Floquet exponents $\xi_i$ using $\protect{\lambda_i = \exp(\xi_i T)}$ (see \figureref{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Discussion of the dynamical instabilities}

The evolution of the dynamical instability $\hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k})$ given by \eqref{Peaks:DynamicalInstability} is equivalent to that of the non-degenerate parametric amplifier \citep{WallsMilburn}, which is a model for the parametric down-conversion of light by a non-linear crystal. In parametric down-conversion, two EPR\footnote{FIXME: EPR entanglement will need to be defined somewhere} entangled photons are produced at frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with growth rate $\gamma$ from a classical seed beam at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 + \omega_2$. Analogously, in the case of the He* BEC discussed at the start of this chapter the evolution represented by \eqref{Peaks:DynamicalInstability} will result in the spontaneous formation of EPR entangled pairs of excitations, one in each of the $\hat{\Lambda}(\pm \bm{k})$ modes. Although these modes will be entangled upon production, it does not necessarily follow that parts of the outcoupled atom laser will be entangled; the entangled $\hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k})$ modes are each superpositions of $m_F=1$ and $m_F=0$ states, but only the $m_F=0$ atoms can leave the condensate. However, if the $m_F=1$ components of the entangled modes are assumed to be outcoupled faster than the time to reverse their momenta ($\unit[9]{ms}$), then number difference squeezing between the atom laser components with opposite axial momenta may be observed.

These excitations would not necessarily be expected to form along the tight trapping directions. Of the three most unstable modes in \figureref{Peaks:CondensateEigenvalues}, the shortest wavelength for these excitations is $\lambda \approx \unit[3]{\micro m}$ which is not significantly smaller than the Thomas-Fermi radius in this dimension of $\rho_\text{TF} = \unit[9.4]{\micro m}$. Hence the local density approximation will not be satisfied in this dimension as the condensate density decays to zero over this distance. However, as the Thomas-Fermi radius in the axial dimension is $z_\text{TF} = \unit[175]{\micro m}$, the local density approximation will be a good approximation for describing the excitations along that dimension.

This effect also depends on the scattering length for collisions between $m_F=0$ atoms being significantly smaller than both the 1--1 and 1--0 scattering lengths as no instabilities were found in the $\kappa = 1$ limit (see \sectionref{Peaks:Kappa1Limit}). 
Consequently, this effect would not be expected to be observed in atoms like $\nucl{87}{}{Rb}$.

Verification that the $\hat{\Lambda}(\bm{k})$ quasiparticles are the origin of the peak-like structure observed in the experiment required a full 3D field calculation, which is discussed in \sectionref{Peaks:3DCalculation}.  The argument made in this section that the observed structure is due to the formation of pairs of quasiparticles formed via a spontaneous four-wave mixing process indicate that a Gross-Pitaevskii model will be unable to reproduce the observations. Such a mean-field model will be insufficient due to the absence of the vacuum fluctuations which are critical to all spontaneous processes.

\section{Full 3D calculation}
\label{Peaks:3DCalculation}
In the previous section it was found that the process of outcoupling from the He* BEC discussed in \sectionref{Peaks:ExperimentalSetup} results in certain modes within the condensate becoming unstable. It was argued that these instabilities will be the original cause of the observed structure in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults}. To verify this hypothesis, a detailed numerical simulation of the experiment was performed.

The master equation that describes the experiment described in \sectionref{Peaks:ExperimentalSetup} is given by
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:MasterEquation}
    \frac{d \hat{\rho}}{d t} &= \frac{-i}{\hbar} [\hat{H},\, \hat{\rho} ] + \frac{27}{5} K^\text{(unpol)}_{^{4}\text{He}} \int d \bm{x}\, \mathcal{D}\left[\hat{\Xi}_{\ket{0,0}} \right] \hat{\rho},
\end{align}
where $\displaystyle\hat{\Xi}_\ket{S, m_S}$ is the annihilation operator for the molecular $\displaystyle \text{He}^*_2$ state with total hyperfine spin $S$ and projection $m_S$, $\mathcal{D}[\hat{c}]\hat{\rho} \equiv \hat{c}\hat{\rho}\hat{c}^\dagger - \frac{1}{2}(\hat{c}^\dagger \hat{c} \hat{\rho} + \hat{\rho} \hat{c}^\dagger \hat{c})$ is the usual decoherence superoperator, and the second term on the RHS in \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation} is due to Penning ionisation (refer to \sectionref{BackgroundTheory:Helium}) with $K^\text{(unpol)}_{^{4}\text{He}}$ the Penning ionisation rate for an unpolarised thermal sample of He* \citep{Stas:2006kx}. The Hamiltonian in \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation} is given by
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:3DHamiltonian}
    \begin{split}
    \hat{H} &= \sum_i \int d\bm{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \left(\frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2 M} + V_i(\bm{x})\right)\hat{\Psi}_i^{\phantom{\dagger}} + \sum_{S, m_S} g_{S}\int d\bm{x}\, \hat{\Xi}_\ket{S, m_S}^\dagger \hat{\Xi}_\ket{S, m_S}^{\phantom{\dagger}}\\
    \\
            &\phantom{=} + \sqrt{2} \hbar \Omega \sum_{i j}\int d\bm{x}\, \hat{\Psi}_i^\dagger \left(\delta_{i, j+1} + \delta_{i, j-1}\right) \hat{\Psi}_j^{\phantom{\dagger}},
    \end{split}
\end{align}
$\displaystyle \hat{\Psi}_i(\bm{x})$ is the annihilation operator for the atomic state $\displaystyle \ket{F=1, m_F=i}$, $V_i(\bm{x})$ is the potential experienced by that state, and $g_S = 4 \pi \hbar^2 a_S/M$ is the nonlinear interaction strength, and $a_S$ is the $s$-wave scattering length for the total hyperfine spin $S$ channel (refer to \sectionref{BackgroundTheory:Helium}). The molecular annihilation operator $\displaystyle \hat{\Xi}_\ket{S, m_S}$ is defined in terms of the atomic annihilation operators and the appropriate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients \citep{Ho:1998}. For example $\displaystyle \hat{\Xi}_\ket{S=0, m_S=0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left[ 2 \hat{\Psi}_1 \hat{\Psi}_{-1} - \hat{\Psi}_0 \hat{\Psi}_0\right]$.

In the first instance, we wish to verify the results of the previous section within a fully three-dimensional model and determine the pattern that would be observed on the detector in this case. Although a similar system was solved with the GP equation in \sectionref{TransverseProfile:Helium} when the transverse profile of a He* atom laser was considered, it is not possible to solve the system corresponding to \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation} with available computational infrastructure. The difference between these two systems is in the axial dimension.

When modelling the transverse profile of the atom laser, the tight aspect ratio of the condensate meant that outcoupled atoms would be accelerated much more along the radial trapping directions than along the axial trapping direction. This permitted the use of a much larger spatial grid separation in the axial dimension than in the radial dimensions. In the present system it is expected that there will exist instabilities with momenta that correspond to a substantial fraction of that which the atom laser would have after leaving the condensate ($\sim \unit[2 \times 10^6]{m\textsuperscript{-1}}$ as compared to $\sim \unit[4 \times 10^6]{m\textsuperscript{-1}}$). In the present case the spatial grid separation in the axial dimension must be comparable to that used in the radial dimensions. Exacerbating this problem is that the tighter aspect ratio in the experiment described in this chapter requires this significantly smaller spatial grid separation be used over a larger range. To perform a simulation using a method similar to that used in \sectionref{TransverseProfile:Helium} approximately $\unit[500]{GiB}$ of memory would be needed to simply store the wavefunctions for the system. Additional approximations are necessary to make this system tractable.

One of the most effective ways to reduce the size of a problem is by reducing its dimensionality. Although the master equation \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation} possesses no continuous symmetries, near the BEC it is approximately cylindrically symmetric. The only term breaking this cylindrical symmetry is the gravitational potential $V_\text{grav}(\bm{x}) =- M \bm{g} \cdot \bm{x}$ where $\bm{g}$ is the gravitational field strength. While this term can be neglected over the region close to the BEC as it varies by only $10\%$ of the chemical potential of the BEC, it certainly cannot be neglected when considering the propagation of the atom laser onto the detector located $\unit[4]{cm}$ below. However, as discussed in \sectionref{TransverseProfile:Helium} the evolution of the atom laser in the region below the BEC is well described by free fall with the exception of fine-scale interference effects. In this chapter it is only the large-scale structure that is of interest, enabling a classical description for the atom laser to be used after it leaves the immediate vicinity of the condensate where the important dynamics will occur.

To solve the system corresponding to the master equation \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation}, a two-step method is used. First, the system will either be modelled with a GP equation or a Truncated Wigner method in a restricted cylindrical region enclosing the condensate using absorbing boundary layers (see \sectionref{BackgroundTheory:AbsorbingBoundaryLayers}) to prevent the atom laser interacting with the artificial boundary conditions. Second, the momentum flux density leaving the simulation region (calculated using a method described in \sectionref{Peaks:AbsorbingBoundaryTricks}) is then propagated classically to determine the profile on the detector, which is located $\unit[4]{cm}$ below the BEC. This two-step procedure will permit the use of cylindrical symmetry to reduce the dimensionality of the computational domain while still considering the full three-dimensional behaviour of the system.

\subsection{Choice of artificial boundary conditions}

An appropriate representation of the solution on cylindrical domains is as a sum of Bessel functions as these are the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator in cylindrical coordinates. The use of this basis to solve the GP equation is described in \citep{Ronen:2006}. Although the Bessel function basis is arguably a better basis, the choice of boundary conditions is artificial and for the results presented in \citep{Dall:2009} a Fourier basis was used. Care must be taken when using a Fourier basis to avoid numerical instabilities due to the form of the Laplacian operator in cylindrical coordinates,
\begin{align}
    \nabla^2 u(r, z) &= \frac{\partial^2 u(r, z)}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial u(r, z)}{\partial r} + \frac{\partial^2 u(r, z)}{\partial z^2}.
\end{align}
Specifically, the radial grid must be chosen to exclude the origin due to the apparent divergence in the $r^{-1}$ term in the Laplacian. Note that this is divergence is not real; for sufficiently well-behaved $u(r, z)$, $\nabla^2 u(r, z)$ will be continuous at the origin.

We may then like to discuss the fact that the Bessel basis will be used for the results presented in this chapter/section. If we do say this, then we can say that the Fourier basis was used due to limitations of the tools. This problem has since been rectified (refer to appropriate appendix), and the results presented here differ negligibly from the results presented in the paper, but are used for demonstration purposes. FIXME: Needs rephrasing.

\subsection{Calculation of the momentum flux density}
\label{Peaks:AbsorbingBoundaryTricks}

As discussed previously, it is necessary to calculate the momentum flux density leaving the simulation region near the condensate to be able to propagate the atom laser classically onto the MCP detector below the condensate. The simulation will necessarily make use of an absorbing boundary layer (refer to \sectionref{BackgroundTheory:AbsorbingBoundaryLayers}) to prevent the outgoing atom laser interacting with the artificial boundary conditions at the edge of the computational domain.  In the case of a perfect absorbing boundary layer the dynamics inside the `region of interest' (see \figureref{Peaks:RegionOfInterest}) will be exactly the same as if the problem were solved on the infinite domain. We wish to calculate the momentum density flux $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ leaving the region of interest. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{RegionOfInterest}
    \caption{\label{Peaks:RegionOfInterest} A snapshot of the total density from a GP simulation corresponding to the system under discussion in this chapter. It can be observed that the atom laser density is decaying within the computational region. The region of interest and absorbing boundary layer are marked. FIXME: Add figure.}
\end{figure}

The rate and distribution with which momentum leaves the region of interest can be determined by considering the equation of motion for the wavenumber density in the region of interest,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \abs{\widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}(\bm{k}, t)}^2}{\partial t} &= 2 \Re \left\{ \widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}^*(\bm{k}, t) \frac{\partial \widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}(\bm{k}, t)}{\partial t} \right \},
\end{align}
where $\widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}(\bm{k}, t)$ is the Fourier transform of the restricted wavefunction $\psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t)$ defined to be nonzero only within the region of interest. The equation of motion for $\widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}(\bm{k}, t)$ is
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:PsikROIEquationOfMotion}
    \frac{\partial \widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}(\bm{k}, t)}{\partial t} &= -\frac{i}{\hbar} \mathcal{F}\left[\left(-\frac{\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2M} + V(\bm{x}) + U \abs{\psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t)}^2\right) \psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t)\right](\bm{k}),
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{F}[f(\bm{x})](\bm{k})$ denotes the Fourier transform of the function $f(\bm{x})$. While the potential and interaction terms in \eqref{Peaks:PsikROIEquationOfMotion} redistribute momentum, it is only due to the kinetic term that momentum will leave the region of interest. To see that this is true, consider a Hamiltonian with no kinetic term. In this case the local phase of the wavefunction will rotate, but the density distribution will remain unchanged. Hence it will be the kinetic term in \eqref{Peaks:PsikROIEquationOfMotion} that will determine the momentum density flux leaving the region of interest.

The Fourier transform of the kinetic term in \eqref{Peaks:PsikROIEquationOfMotion} can be evaluated to give the momentum density flux $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ leaving the region of interest in terms of a surface integral over the boundary of the region of interest,
\begin{align}
    \Phi(\bm{k}, t) & = -\frac{\partial \abs{\widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}(\bm{k}, t)}^2}{\partial t}\bigg|_\text{kinetic}\\
    & = -2 \Re \left\{ \frac{i \hbar}{2 M} \widetilde{\psi}_\text{roi}^*(\bm{k}, t) \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{\frac{3}{2}}}\oiint e^{-i \bm{k}\cdot \bm{x}} \Big[ \nabla \psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t) + i \bm{k} \psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t)\Big] \cdot d \bm{A} \right\}.
    \label{Peaks:MomentumDensityFluxSurfaceIntegral}
\end{align}
The $\psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t)$ and $\nabla\psi_\text{roi}(\bm{x}, t)$ terms to be evaluated at the boundary in \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFluxSurfaceIntegral} should be understood to be defined by the limit from the interior of the region of interest. While \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFluxSurfaceIntegral} is the most direct way of evaluating $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$, it is a computationally inefficient method as it requires the calculation of a surface integral for every point $\bm{k}$ at which we wish to evaluate $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$. 

A more efficient method can be found by instead considering the evolution of the wavenumber density in the absorbing boundary layer (see \figureref{Peaks:RegionOfInterest}). The momentum flux density that left the region of interest enters the absorbing boundary layer through a term like \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFluxSurfaceIntegral}, but leaves due to the negative imaginary potential. Assuming that the mean-field interaction energy of the wavefunction reaching the absorbing boundary layer is small compared to its kinetic energy, the momentum flux density leaving the region of interest is also given by
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:MomentumDensityFlux}
    \Phi(\bm{k}, t)&=\frac{2}{\hbar} \Re \left\{ \widetilde{\psi}_\text{abl}^*(\bm{k}, t) \mathcal{F}'\left[ V_I(\bm{x}) \psi_\text{abl}(\bm{x}, t)\right](\bm{k}) \right\},
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{F}'$ is the appropriate Fourier-like transform that guarantees the artificial boundary conditions are satisfied, $\widetilde{\psi}_\text{abl}(\bm{k}, t)$ is the $\mathcal{F}'$-transform of the restricted wavefunction $\psi_\text{abl}(\bm{x}, t)$ defined to be nonzero only within the absorbing boundary layer. For periodic boundary conditions, $\mathcal{F}'$ is the Fourier transform; for Dirichlet boundary conditions with the wavefunction set to zero on the boundary, it is the Fourier Sine transform; for Neumann boundary conditions with the derivative of the wavefunction set to zero, it is the Fourier Cosine transform. Equation \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFlux} is a more efficient method of evaluating $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ than \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFluxSurfaceIntegral} as it only requires two Fourier-like transforms to evaluate $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ for all $\bm{k}$, instead of one surface integral \emph{for each} $\bm{k}$.

The information provided by either \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFluxSurfaceIntegral} or \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFlux} will only be as good as the absorbing boundary layer. While for a perfect absorbing boundary layer $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ would exactly match the rate at which momentum density leaves the computational domain, for an imperfect absorbing boundary layer $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ will also include contributions from any reflection from or transmission through the boundary layer. 

An example calculation of $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ for a finite absorbing boundary layer is given in \sectionref{MethodsAppendix:MomentumDensityFluxExampleCalculation}. There it is demonstrated that $\Phi(\bm{k}, t)$ is an accurate method for determining the rate of loss of momentum density from a region of space for the same range of momenta for which the absorbing boundary layer is itself accurate.

The simulations described in the remainder of this chapter use the method presented in this section to determine the momentum distribution of atoms that have left computational domain. This momentum distribution is then propagated classically under gravity to find the corresponding density distribution on the MCP detector below the condensate. This classical propagation was performed by \emph{Mattias Johnsson}. Note that due to the use of cylindrical symmetry, the correct Fourier-like transform for use in \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFlux} is the Hankel (or Bessel) transform \citep{ArfkeyWeber}.

\subsection{Next section}
Things that need to be discussed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Theorist's on-resonance case. This is important because it shows agreement with the Floquet exponents calculated in an earlier section.
    \item In this case, we need to perform both TW and GP simulations demonstrating that the peaks are only observed in the TW case and they obey the usual stuff. At this point we need to say why we are only using a two-level model here. If the Hankel simulations are working, then we will use those for these results and also try a three-level (proper) version.
    \item Experimentalist's on-resonance case. Show the detuning plot so that we know exactly what the difference is and why. Extra points may need to be calculated for that curve. Then show the GP and TW results in the appropriate limit. Here is where we need to argue about how things are related to one another.
    \item Future work and conclude.
\end{enumerate}

Most of these sections can be written before the figures are available. The final figures can then be added as they are completed.

\subsection{Theorist's on-resonance}

We now consider the case of outcoupling from the centre of the BEC. This is the case that corresponds most closely to that considered in \sectionref{Peaks:PerturbativeApproach}. We begin first by considering the GP equations that correspond to the master equation \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation},
\begin{subequations}
    \label{Peaks:3DGPEquations}
    \begin{align}
        \begin{split}
            i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi_1}{\partial t} &= \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2 M} \Psi_1 + \big(V_\text{trap}(\bm{x}) - i V_I(\bm{x})\big)\Psi_1 + \sqrt{2} \hbar \Omega \Psi_0 \\
            & \relphantom{=} + c_0 \sum_j \abs{\Psi_j}^2 \Psi_1 + c_2\left(\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2 - \abs{\Psi_{-1}}^2 \right) \Psi_1 + c_2 \Psi_{-1}^*\Psi_0^2 \\
            & \relphantom{=} - i \hbar\frac{27}{15}K^\text{(unpol)}_{^{4}\text{He}} \left(2\abs{\Psi_{-1}}^2 \Psi_1 - \Psi_{-1}^* \Psi_0^2\right),
        \end{split}\\
        \begin{split}
            i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi_0}{\partial t} &= \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2 M} \Psi_0 + \big(-\hbar \Delta - i V_I(\bm{x}) \big)\Psi_0 + \sqrt{2} \hbar \Omega \Psi_1 + \sqrt{2}\hbar\Omega \Psi_{-1} \\
            & \relphantom{=} + c_0 \sum_j \abs{\Psi_j}^2 \Psi_0 + c_2\left(\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_{-1}}^2 \right) \Psi_0 + 2 c_2 \Psi_{0}^*\Psi_1\Psi_{-1} \\
            & \relphantom{=} - i \hbar\frac{27}{15}K^\text{(unpol)}_{^{4}\text{He}} \left(\abs{\Psi_{0}}^2 \Psi_0 - 2\Psi_{0}^* \Psi_1\Psi_{-1}\right),
        \end{split}\\
        \begin{split}
            i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi_{-1}}{\partial t} &= \frac{-\hbar^2 \nabla^2}{2 M} \Psi_{-1} + \big(-V_\text{trap}(\bm{x}) - 2 \hbar \Delta - i V_I(\bm{x})\big)\Psi_{-1} + \sqrt{2} \hbar \Omega \Psi_0 \\
            & \relphantom{=} + c_0 \sum_j \abs{\Psi_j}^2 \Psi_{-1} + c_2\left(-\abs{\Psi_1}^2 + \abs{\Psi_0}^2 + \abs{\Psi_{-1}}^2 \right) \Psi_{-1} + c_2 \Psi_{1}^*\Psi_0^2 \\
            & \relphantom{=} - i \hbar\frac{27}{15}K^\text{(unpol)}_{^{4}\text{He}} \left(2\abs{\Psi_{1}}^2 \Psi_{-1} - \Psi_{1}^* \Psi_0^2\right),
        \end{split}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\displaystyle V_\text{trap}(\bm{x}) = \frac{1}{2} M \left(\omega_r^2 r^2 + \omega_z^2 z^2 \right)$ is the trapping potential, $\hbar \Delta$ is the detuning in energy of the resonant outcoupling surface from the centre of the condensate, $c_0 = (g_0 + 2 g_2)/3$, $c_2 = (g_2 - g_0)/3$, where $g_S = 4 \pi \hbar^2 a_S/M$ is the nonlinear interaction strength, and $a_S$ is the $s$-wave scattering length for the total hyperfine spin $S$ channel (refer to \sectionref{BackgroundTheory:Helium}).

The Truncated Wigner equations corresponding to the master equation \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation} are very similar to \eqref{Peaks:3DGPEquations} but with the addition of noise-correction terms,
\begin{align}
    \label{Peaks:3DTWEquations}
    \left. i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi_j}{\partial t}\right|_\text{TW} &= \left. i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi_j}{\partial t}\right|_\text{GP} - \left(2 c_0 + c_2 - i \hbar \frac{27}{15}K^\text{(unpol)}_{^4\text{He}}\right)\frac{1}{\Delta V}\Psi_j + i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar V_I(\bm{x})}{2}} \xi_j(\bm{x}),
\end{align}
where $\Delta V$ is the volume element (here the Gaussian quadrature weight \citep{Ronen:2006}), and $\xi_j(\bm{x})$ are independent time- and spatially-dependent complex Gaussian noises with variance $\displaystyle \left(dt\, \Delta V\right)^{-1}$. Note that \eqref{Peaks:3DTWEquations} are the same in Itô or Stratonovich form. In obtaining \eqref{Peaks:3DTWEquations}, both the second and third order derivatives of the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the Penning ionisation term have been neglected. This is because Penning ionisation is a small loss process and we are not so much worried about the loss of noise that will result. On the other hand, the absorbing boundary layer will remove much of the high-momentum noise quickly, and a process is needed to restore that to make sure that the process occurs\footnote{Evaluate the Penning loss curve and display.}\footnote{FIXME: Clean up paragraph}.

There is a corresponding correction term to \eqref{Peaks:MomentumDensityFlux},
\begin{align}
    \left. \Phi(\bm{k}, t) \right|_\text{TW} &= \left. \Phi(\bm{k}, t) \right|_\text{GP} + 2 \Re \left\{ \widetilde{\psi}_\text{abl}^*(\bm{k}, t) \mathcal{F}'\left[\sqrt{\frac{V_I(\bm{x})}{2 \hbar}} \xi(\bm{x}) \right](\bm{k})\right\},
\end{align}
where the appropriate noise $\xi(\bm{x})$ is used corresponding to the state whose momentum density flux is being calculated.

The figure corresponding to the GP equations will have no visible excitations in any of the levels. (Classical) Green's functions would be the best method for doing the propagation.

Somewhere in here we need to justify the absence of the 3rd level. Oooh. 3rd level moves rapidly. It requires shorter time steps. Blah-de-blah-de-blah.

In an ideal world, the work would be over once a set of equations has been derived that can model a system. Unfortunately, technical considerations are a fact of every day life that must be considered when determining what problems can and cannot be solved. In this case, although the GP equations given in \eqref{Peaks:3DGPEquations} can be solved in a reasonable amount of time on a supercomputer, \eqref{Peaks:3DTWEquations} represents a much more challenging problem. Not only do these equations need to be solved a large number of times ($N_\text{paths} \gtrsim 100$) for different initial conditions, but lower-order algorithms are necessitated to solve stochastic differential equations than can be used with deterministic differential equations. This problem is exacerbated by the $\Psi_{-1}$ state which, due to the antitrapping potential, reaches significantly larger velocities over the computational domain than either the $\Psi_0$ or $\Psi_1$ states hence requiring smaller time steps. For these reasons it is necessary to neglect the $\Psi_{-1}$ state for the TW equations and only simulate a handful of paths.

\begin{figure}

    FIXME: Perform final simulations and create figure.
    \caption{\label{Peaks:TheoryZeroDetuningResults} Simulation results for outcoupling from the centre of the condensate. Left figures (a), (c) and (e) plot the momentum density of the untrapped state at $t=\unit[\text{FIXME}]{ms}$. Right figures (b), (d) and (f) plot the density profiles that would be observed on the MCP detector. The upper figures (a) and (b) plot the results of a GP model including all $m_F$ atomic levels. Middle figures (c) and (d) plot the results of a reduced GP model where the $m_F=-1$ is assumed negligible, lower figures (e) and (f) correspond to a Truncated Wigner simulation for the same system. The wavenumbers the perturbation analysis performed in \sectionref{Peaks:PerturbativeApproach} predicted to be unstable are marked in (e).}
\end{figure}

We need to discuss the results to say that the unstable modes predicted by the work in \sectionref{Peaks:PerturbativeApproach} agree quite well with the results pictured in \figureref{Peaks:TheoryZeroDetuningResults}. Hooray! The corresponding density on the detector are likely to be number-difference squeezed, but clearly checking this is well beyond any computational capacity we have. A three-level TW simulation would also be nice, but for the reasons mentioned, it is slightly out of reach.

\subsection{Experimentalist's on-resonance}

Although the results shown in \figureref{Peaks:TheoryZeroDetuningResults} are highly suggestive that the experimental observations in \sectionref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults} are caused by the unstable modes discussed in \sectionref{Peaks:PerturbativeApproach}, the experimental situation corresponding to the results pictured in \figureref{Peaks:ExperimentalResults} were not observed when outcoupling from the centre of the condensate. Instead the outcoupling position corresponded to the detuning at which the atom laser flux is maximal. Because of blah-blah-blah, this will be detuned somewhat. To calibrate this information, we need to perform 3D GP simulations outcoupling the atom laser to compare flux. Results are shown in blah. As you can see, the detuning must be about blah.

We need to discuss the artificial boundary conditions used. Mention that Fourier boundary conditions were used in the paper, which are less than optimal, but used due to the limitations of the tools at hand. That said, the results presented here use the Hankel transform (discussed in a numerical methods appendix) and differ negligibly (they bloody well better) from the results in the paper.

We also need to discuss the method used to obtain the momentum flux density.

As noted in the previous section, a GP equation model corresponding to \eqref{Peaks:MasterEquation} will be unable to reproduce the instability as it is spontaneously-seeded. 


% 
% Two options: 
% * Describe the Hamiltonian used in the paper, and risk it being noticed.
%     - Under review, this may be noticed, and if that occurs, it would lead to very, very bad things.
% * Use the other Hamiltonian and justify neglecting the mF=-1 state.
%     - The approximation will be noticed, and discussed. The question may be asked why I didn't try and not make this approximation.
% 
% The direction of the previous section has been in the line of the two-level model. But it leaves it so open to questions being asked.
% Alternatively, I can solve *different* models for different reasons. I would then need to justify only using a two-level model for TW simulations, but can get away with a full 3D model for GP simulations. This appears to be the best approach.
% 
% Must justify using only two levels for TW, but three for GP.
% This requires doing the TW and GP simulations again but using Hankel transforms.
% 
% Method: 
%     2-level TW to see what the instabilities give rise to.
%     2-level TW at correct detuning to see what happens.
%     3-level GP at correct detuning for final results.
% This method requires a justification of 2-level for TW. A 2-level model can be justified in terms of checking what the previous analysis gives rise to, and then a full 3-level model could be discussed. In fact, we could discuss early on that the detuning doesn't correspond to the centre of the condensate (probably reference an earlier chapter), do a 2-level TW corresponding to that to see what happens, and then do 3-level TW and GP corresponding to the actual outcoupling position used in the experiment. That would then require justification of the link between the two phenomena. It's physics, it has to work. This justification must stand up to scrutiny by Craig and John. Oooh. I could even admit that the link isn't entirely solid. I could argue that the complicated dynamics would prevent any analytic determination of the behaviour, it could be the subject of future work to see if these bloody things are correlated.
% 
% This then requires some motivation that the two phenomena are related. Something about the sweeping resonance crap I used before. One really good way of doing this would be by analogy. Some analogy with some other crap that is also produced in a similar way. The other possibility would be the initial outcoupling process leading to a resonance sweep. Initial dynamics. That must be it. Fourier arguments. I then need a density-dependent resonance. Three-levels. Complicated stuff. Wave hands.
% 
% I can justify the 2-level. No I can't. It's bloody deterministic... Unless I include the proper noise due to the absorbing boundary and/or penning ionisation. Oooh. That could actually save my bacon.
% 
% And it would actually be true. Neglect the Penning ionisation noise terms. Somewhere I must discuss the correct Master equation term for Penning ionisation. I'm guessing that's going to need to be in an earlier chapter that discusses the properties of Rubidium and Helium. And I should somewhere mention Lesa's work on building a dual-species Rubidium-Helium BEC.
% 
% Semi-Implicit low-order algorithms to the rescue... Whether I actually calculate it that way or not... we'll see.
% 
% Can I say things that went wrong? Things to avoid?
% 
% I can even perform 2-level and 3-level GP simulations of the zero-detuning case. I just can't do a 3-level TW simulation there.
% 
% So: start with the full master equation and work down from there as we go. The remaining question is how best to write that master equation.

% For the same reasons mentioned at the start of \sectionref{Peaks:PerturbativeApproach}, the $m_F=-1$ state can be neglected. This approximation is only necessary for technical reasons, as the full 3D calculation requires excessive computational resources.
